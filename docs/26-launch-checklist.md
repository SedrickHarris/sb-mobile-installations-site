## 1. Purpose

This checklist defines the controlled steps required to move the website from approved preview to production.

It follows:

- 17-cloudflare-deployment.md;
- 18-github-workflow.md;
- 23-accessibility-standards.md;
- 24-performance-budget.md; and
- 25-quality-assurance-checklist.md.

The site should not be published merely because the build succeeds. Launch requires business approval, technical evidence, intentional indexation, and verified recruitment and commercial journeys.

---

## 2. Launch Roles

Record an owner for each role:

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Business approver | Confirms facts, claims, jobs, services, and launch scope |
| Content/SEO owner | Confirms page intent, metadata, internal links, and indexation |
| Build owner | Confirms code, tests, and release commit |
| Deployment owner | Confirms GitHub, Cloudflare Pages, domains, and environment |
| Form owner | Confirms routing, notifications, anti-abuse, and confirmations |
| Measurement owner | Confirms analytics, Search Console, Bing, and reporting |

One person may hold multiple roles, but ownership must be explicit.

---

## 3. Launch Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Ready | Verified and approved |
| Blocked | Must be resolved before launch |
| Conditional | Depends on a feature or page that is not launching |
| Waived | Documented exception with owner and date |
| Not verified | Not acceptable as a final status |
