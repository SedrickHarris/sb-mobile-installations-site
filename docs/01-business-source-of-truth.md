# SB Mobile Installations Business Source of Truth

**Document:** 01-business-source-of-truth.md  
**Project:** SB Mobile Installations Website Rebuild  
**Business:** SB Mobile Installations, LLC  
**Status:** Discovery draft  
**Version:** 0.9  
**Last updated:** September 10, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This document is the canonical source for business facts used throughout the SB Mobile Installations website project. It exists to prevent assumptions, legacy language, recruiting requirements, third-party information, and proposed marketing ideas from becoming unsupported public claims.

Use this document before writing or approving:

- Website copy
- Metadata
- Structured data
- Forms
- Contact information
- Service pages
- Industry pages
- Audience and solution pages
- Technology pages
- Service-area pages
- Case studies
- Careers content
- Directory profiles
- Google Business Profile content
- Bing Places content
- Apple Business Connect content
- Social profile descriptions
- Press or partnership material

If a fact is not approved here or in a more specific canonical registry, treat it as unverified.

---

## 2. Authority and precedence

When sources conflict, use the following order:

1. Written confirmation from an authorized SB Mobile Installations representative
2. Approved contracts, licenses, certifications, policies, and internal company records
3. Approved canonical project registries
4. Current official company website content
5. Current official company-controlled profiles
6. Current recruiting material
7. Reputable third-party directories and publications
8. Search results, cached pages, competitor content, and other secondary sources

Lower-priority sources may identify facts that require verification. They do not override a higher-priority source.

---

## 3. Status definitions

| Status | Meaning | Public use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approved | Confirmed by an authorized company representative or authoritative record | Allowed within the approved scope |
| Existing website statement | Currently stated on the company website but not independently confirmed | Preserve carefully; verify before expanding |
| Recruiting evidence | Appears in company recruiting content as a technician duty or preferred qualification | Do not automatically convert into a customer-facing service |
| External evidence | Appears in a third-party source | Use for discovery only until confirmed |
| Proposed | Recommended for strategy or information architecture | Not a company fact |
| Inferred | Reasonable interpretation of available information | Label internally; do not publish as fact |
| Pending verification | Important fact with insufficient or conflicting support | Do not publish definitively |
| Prohibited until supported | Claim presents elevated legal, brand, safety, partnership, or credibility risk | Do not publish without documentation |
| Retired | Previously used but no longer current | Do not publish except in accurate historical context |

---

## 4. Entity record

| Field | Current value | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Legal business name | SB Mobile Installations, LLC | Approved, internal only | Client confirmed as the sole operating entity. Never published. See section 4.2 |
| Public-facing name | SB Mobile Installations | Approved | Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026 as the only name used publicly. See section 4.2 |
| Abbreviated name | SB Mobile | Existing website statement | Existing homepage uses this shortened form |
| Current website | https://sbmobileinstallations.com/ | Approved for current-site reference | Confirm this will remain the production domain |
| New repository | https://github.com/SedrickHarris/sb-mobile-installations-site.git | Approved project fact | New website repository |

### 4.1 Sole operating entity

SB Mobile Installations, LLC is the sole operating entity referenced throughout the website.

**Status:** Approved. Client confirmed.

There is no Doral Transport LLC relationship to document. Do not represent Doral Transport LLC as a parent, affiliate, employer, contracting entity, hiring entity, or operating company, and do not present the two names as interchangeable.

One entity is responsible for recruiting, hiring or contracting, payment, supervision, and installer management. Use SB Mobile Installations, LLC as the organization in company copy, employment and contractor language, privacy notices, forms, and structured data.

Several other project documents still describe this relationship as unresolved and block content on it. Those documents require a follow-up update to reflect this confirmation.

### 4.2 "LLC" is never published

**The public company name is SB Mobile Installations. It never carries "LLC".**

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

> Remove "LLC" from the company name on all customer facing content. "LLC" will not be included in the company name in this project. Hard rule.

**Provenance.** This instruction came directly from the stakeholder on September 10, 2026, delivered outside the build thread and relayed into it verbatim. It was not inferred from the brand kit, not derived from the existing copy, and not proposed by the build. The quotation above is the stakeholder's own wording.

This note exists so a future review does not re-flag the change as unauthorized. The removal touched legal pages and structured data, which normally carry the registered entity, and that is exactly the kind of edit a reviewer should challenge without a recorded source. The source is recorded here.

This is a project-wide content rule, not a page-level preference. It applies to every customer-facing surface, which includes page copy, headings, navigation, footers, legal pages, metadata, structured data values, alt text, form labels, error messages, email templates, and job postings.

The registered entity remains SB Mobile Installations, LLC, and section 4 records it as a business fact. That form stays internal. Do not publish it, and do not reintroduce it through a schema `legalName` property, an Open Graph `siteName`, or a copyright line.

Internal project documents in `docs/` are not customer-facing and may name the registered entity where the legal fact is the point, as this section does.

The brand kit supplied on September 10, 2026 gives the same instruction under its do-not list. The two agree.

**Note for review, not a blocker.** Privacy and terms pages conventionally identify the registered legal entity, and both pages previously did. They no longer do. The pages already carry a notice that they have not been reviewed by an attorney. Confirm with counsel whether the entity form is required in those two documents specifically before launch.

## 5. Contact information

### 5.1 Telephone numbers

| Number | Source observation | Status | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 623-388-7352 | Displayed on the homepage, contact page, career page, and external recruiting listing | Verified | Approved as the canonical business telephone number |
| 623-338-7352 | Displayed on the current contact page | Rejected | Do not publish. Treat as a typographical error and correct wherever it appears |

**623-388-7352 is the canonical business telephone number.** Stakeholder confirmed
on September 10, 2026.

Use this number consistently across website copy, metadata, structured data,
business profiles, directory citations, and recruiting listings. Name, address, and
phone consistency depends on a single canonical value.

623-338-7352 is rejected. Where it appears on the current site or in any third-party
listing, correct it as part of citation cleanup.

### 5.2 Email addresses

| Purpose | Current value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General inquiries | Unknown | Pending verification |
| Sales and quotes | Unknown | Pending verification |
| Installation service | Unknown | Pending verification |
| Provider partnerships | Unknown | Pending verification |
| Careers | Unknown | Pending verification |
| Accounts or billing | Unknown | Pending verification |

Do not invent departmental email addresses.

### 5.3 Address

**The company does not publish a physical or mailing address.**

**Status:** Approved. Client confirmed.

SB Mobile Installations operates a mobile-only model. Service is delivered at the customer's location. There is no walk-in location, no customer-facing office, and no address to publish.

Consequences:

- Do not publish a street address, mailing address, or map in website copy, footers, contact pages, or structured data.
- The business is not eligible for a standard storefront-style Google Business Profile listing. Any future profile work must use a service-area configuration with the address hidden, and only if the client chooses to pursue one.
- `LocalBusiness` structured data that requires a physical address is not usable. Prefer `Organization` for entity markup. See `13-schema-markup-plan.md`.
- Contact pathways rely on the telephone number in section 5.1, approved forms, and email once verified.
- Local content must describe service reach, not a physical presence. See section 8.4.

#### Retired shop-location language

A prior company-authored job posting on Glassdoor, expired January 2026, referenced a "possibility of shop locations." The stakeholder confirmed on September 10, 2026 that this language was outdated and inaccurate. **No physical office or shop exists.**

**Status:** Retired. Do not reintroduce shop-location language in any customer-facing or recruiting content.

This is recorded here so the expired posting does not resurface as an unresolved conflict in a future content pass. See sections 7.1 and 17, which were corrected to remove the same language.

The Goodyear, Arizona association appearing in a third-party directory is **confirmed irrelevant**. It is not a company address, was never approved, and must not be used as a canonical address, a customer-facing location, or a structured-data location. Where it appears in an external directory, treat it as a citation cleanup item rather than a fact to represent.

### 5.4 Business hours

**Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.**

**Status:** Approved. Client confirmed.

These are business hours, not a service-availability guarantee. Do not convert them into same-day response, after-hours availability, emergency service, weekend coverage, or technician scheduling windows. Do not infer extended hours from technician schedules, job listings, or common industry practices.

The time zone and any holiday exceptions remain unconfirmed. Confirm both before publishing hours in structured data.

---

## 6. Approved and observed company description

### 6.1 Current website description

The existing homepage states that SB Mobile provides mobile electronic equipment installation services and has qualified mobile technicians throughout the United States.

It specifically presents:

- Installation and service of GPS equipment
- Mobile technicians
- On-site travel to meet customer needs
- Experience with electrical systems
- Mechanical insight
- Customer service

These are existing website statements. They should be preserved accurately during discovery but verified before being expanded into more specific performance, capacity, certification, or coverage claims.

### 6.2 Working internal description

SB Mobile Installations appears to provide on-site installation and related field services for GPS, electronic logging, fleet-management, video, and other mobile electronic equipment used in fleet and construction vehicles.

**Status:** Inferred from customer-facing and recruiting content.

Do not publish this exact description as approved company copy until the underlying services are confirmed.

### 6.3 Proposed customer-facing positioning

> Nationwide mobile installation services for GPS tracking equipment, ELDs, telematics hardware, fleet cameras, and connected vehicle equipment.

**Status:** Proposed.

Requirements before approval:

- Verify each named service.
- Verify the current meaning and operational extent of nationwide coverage.
- Verify supported equipment and vehicle categories.
- Confirm that connected vehicle equipment is an acceptable umbrella term.

---

## 7. Business model

### 7.1 Observed operating model

Technicians travel to the customer's location. All work is performed on-site.

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

An earlier version of this section recorded that technicians "may also work at shop locations," drawn from an expired Glassdoor posting. The stakeholder confirmed that language was outdated and inaccurate. See the retired shop-location note in section 5.3.

### 7.2 Contractor model

**Technicians are engaged as independent contractors, not employees.**

**Status:** Confirmed.

> Confirmed by stakeholder, September 10, 2026: technicians are independent contractors, not employees.

The stakeholder's words were: "Yes, confirmed - technicians are independent contractors, not employees."

The current career page advertises an independent contractor mobile technician position, which is consistent with this confirmation.

#### Scope of this confirmation

This confirms the **classification only**. It is a general statement about the working relationship and nothing more.

Do not infer any of the following from it. Each remains a separate, unconfirmed item:

- Contract terms, contract length, or termination conditions
- Compensation, pay rates, or payment schedule
- Expense, mileage, travel, or equipment reimbursement
- Work schedule, shift length, or hours committed
- Benefits of any kind
- Tax treatment or filing obligations
- Exclusivity, territory, or volume commitments
- The screening, onboarding, or assignment process

See section 19, which continues to require company review before compensation, schedule, travel percentage, or benefits appear in careers content.

#### Publication limits

- Approved for describing the working relationship in general terms.
- Do not use the classification to imply guaranteed work, hours, income, or acceptance. See `19-claude-project-instructions.md` section 15.
- Do not describe a technician as an employee anywhere in site content, forms, privacy notices, or structured data.
- Worker classification carries legal exposure. Any change in how the relationship is described requires company and, where appropriate, legal review. See `19-claude-project-instructions.md` section 34.

### 7.3 Potential commercial relationships

The website may serve or seek relationships with:

- Fleet operators
- Telematics providers
- GPS and ELD providers
- Equipment manufacturers
- Equipment resellers
- Fleet-management companies
- Installation project managers
- Multi-location commercial organizations

**Status:** Proposed or inferred.

Confirm which customer types are current, desired, and supportable before developing definitive audience pages.

### 7.4 Equipment sales

It is unknown whether SB Mobile:

- Sells equipment
- Resells equipment
- Supplies installation materials only
- Installs customer-supplied equipment
- Installs provider-supplied equipment
- Provides software subscriptions

**Status:** Pending verification.

Do not position the company as an equipment dealer or software provider until confirmed.

---

## 8. Geographic coverage

### 8.1 Existing coverage statement

The homepage states that technicians are located throughout the United States and can travel on-site to meet customer needs.

**Status:** Existing website statement.

### 8.2 Confirmed service area

**The service area is nationwide.**

**Status:** Approved. Client confirmed.

SB Mobile Installations serves customers nationwide through mobile technicians who travel to the customer's location. Nationwide service reach may be stated in website copy, metadata, and structured data as an approved fact.

**This is a geographic fact only.** Project capacity is a separate confirmed fact recorded in section 11.1. The two are independent and must not be conflated. Confirming one says nothing about the other, and a future content pass should check each against its own section rather than re-flagging one while verifying the other.

This confirms **reach**, not capacity. It does not establish same-day availability, universal coverage of every city, guaranteed technician presence in a given market, equal availability across all services, or unlimited project capacity. The caveat in section 25 and the prohibited wording in section 26 continue to apply in full.

### 8.3 Remaining coverage details

Nationwide reach is approved. The following operational details remain unconfirmed and must not be published or implied:

- States with resident technician coverage versus states served through project travel
- Metros with recurring availability
- Response or scheduling expectations
- Minimum project sizes for travel
- Travel charges
- Remote or excluded areas
- Whether nationwide reach applies to every service
- Whether nationwide reach applies to single-vehicle work
- Whether coverage varies by customer or platform

Do not create state or metro location pages on the basis of nationwide reach alone. Page creation still depends on verified capacity in that market, per section 8.4 and `08-url-strategy.md`.

### 8.4 Location representation rule

Do not treat technician coverage as a physical office.

Distinguish:

- Headquarters
- Staffed office
- Customer-facing office
- Mailing address
- Technician base
- Mobile service area
- Temporary deployment area
- State coverage
- Metro coverage

### 8.5 Local profile rule

The client confirmed a mobile-only model with no published address, so the business is not eligible for a standard storefront-style local profile. See section 5.3.

Do not create or optimize a Google Business Profile, Bing Places profile, Apple Business Connect location, `LocalBusiness` schema record, or address citation that asserts a physical customer-facing location. Any future profile must be configured as a service-area business with the address hidden, and only at the client's direction.

## 9. Verified customer-facing services

The current customer-facing website explicitly presents the following:

| Service or capability | Evidence | Status | Public wording limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile electronic equipment installation | Homepage | Existing website statement | May be preserved while the equipment scope is verified |
| GPS equipment installation | Homepage | Existing website statement | May be presented as a current core service, subject to company confirmation |
| GPS equipment service | Homepage | Existing website statement | The meaning of service must be defined before describing repairs or troubleshooting |
| On-site mobile service | Homepage | Existing website statement | Do not promise universal availability or response times |
| United States technician coverage | Homepage | Existing website statement | Verify current operational coverage before expanding the claim |
| Vehicle electrical knowledge | Homepage | Existing website statement | Do not imply a license or certification |
| Mechanical insight | Homepage | Existing website statement | Keep language limited until qualifications are confirmed |
| Customer service | Homepage | Existing website statement | Avoid unsupported guarantees or response-time claims |

### 9.1 Confirmed equipment and service scope

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

> Confirmed by stakeholder, September 10, 2026. SB Mobile Installations installs GPS tracking, ELD, AOBRD, TPMS, and fleet management equipment. Technicians work with platforms including Lytx/DriveCam, SmartDrive, Zonar, LoJack, Interlock, PeopleNet, Trimble, Omnitracs, Samsara, Geotab, CalAmp, and Verizon Connect, plus dashcam and windshield-mounted video recorder installations. Source: stakeholder confirmation of a company-authored Glassdoor job posting's accuracy to current operations.

This supersedes the narrower GPS-only scope that previously constrained public copy and structured data. The equipment categories above may now be stated as current services in customer-facing copy, metadata, and structured data.

Limits that survive this confirmation:

- Platform names are experience context, not a service taxonomy. The usage restrictions in section 14 remain in force in full. Never use a platform name as a structured-data taxonomy value.
- Equipment scope is not capacity. Project capacity was confirmed separately on the same date and is recorded in section 11.1.
- Compensation was not asked about and was not confirmed. See section 19.
- Installation process details were not part of this confirmation. Photo documentation was confirmed separately on the same date and is recorded in section 17.1. The rest of section 17 stays unconfirmed.

---

## 10. Recruiting-supported installation capabilities

The career page describes technician duties involving installation and service of:

- ELD equipment
- GPS equipment
- AOBRD equipment
- Fleet-management equipment

It also seeks experience with:

- Real-time GPS tracking devices
- ELD devices
- EOBR devices
- AOBRD devices
- Dash-camera devices
- Windshield-mounted video recorders
- Tire-pressure monitoring systems
- Mobile electronics

**Status:** Approved as current service scope for the equipment categories listed in section 9.1. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

The categories confirmed in section 9.1 are GPS tracking, ELD, AOBRD, TPMS, fleet management equipment, dashcams, and windshield-mounted video recorders. These are current services, not applicant qualifications only.

EOBR devices and "mobile electronics" as a general category were not named in the confirmation and remain recruiting evidence.

A confirmed category is still not proof that the item is a universally available or separately marketed standalone service page.

Before creating a service page, confirm:

- The service is currently offered.
- The company wants to market it.
- The equipment category is current.
- The company has appropriate technician coverage.
- The service can be explained accurately.
- The page has a meaningful conversion path.

## 11. Proposed service registry candidates

The following are candidates for `06-service-registry.md`:

| Proposed service | Current support | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPS tracking device installation | Explicit homepage statement | High-priority verification |
| GPS equipment service | Explicit homepage statement | Define service scope |
| Electronic logging device installation | Career duties | Verify as customer-facing service |
| Fleet telematics installation | Implied by equipment and platforms | Proposed |
| Fleet dash-camera installation | Career experience requirement | Verify as customer-facing service |
| Fleet-management equipment installation | Career duties | Verify as customer-facing service |
| Vehicle gateway installation | Platform and equipment context | Proposed |
| Mobile data terminal installation | Industry fit; not clearly stated on current site | Proposed |
| TPMS equipment installation | Career experience requirement | Verify as customer-facing service |
| Vehicle electronics installation | Broad homepage category | Define scope |
| Equipment removal and reinstallation | Not clearly stated | Proposed |
| Installation troubleshooting and service | Electrical diagnostic requirements | Verify scope |
| Fleet equipment upgrades | Not clearly stated | Proposed |
| Multi-location fleet installations | Travel and scheduling context | Proposed |
| Nationwide fleet deployments | Reach confirmed in section 8.2, capacity range confirmed in section 11.1 | Approved as the conjunction of two distinct confirmed facts. Simultaneous multi-market volume is still unconfirmed |

No proposed service is approved merely because it appears in this table.

### 11.1 Confirmed project capacity range

**SB Mobile Installations handles projects ranging from a single vehicle to an entire fleet.**

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

> This claim is true. Include in the content, do not remove.

The confirmation establishes a **project capacity range**: the company will take a one-vehicle job and will take a full-fleet job. Approved for customer-facing copy.

This is a different claim from the nationwide geographic reach confirmed in section 8.2. Reach answers where work happens. Capacity range answers how large a single project can be. **Record, cite, and verify them separately.** A future content pass must not treat a confirmation of one as covering the other, and must not re-flag one while checking the other.

What this confirmation does not establish:

- Simultaneous multi-market deployment volume
- Technician availability in a named market on a named date
- Turnaround time for a fleet of any given size
- A guarantee that any specific project will be accepted

Those remain unconfirmed. The general guardrail in section 25 is unchanged and still governs every capacity claim that has not been confirmed the way this one was.

---

## 12. Vehicle and asset types

### 12.1 Explicit or recruiting-supported vehicle categories

| Vehicle or asset category | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fleet vehicles | Stakeholder confirmation, September 10, 2026 | Approved |
| Commercial vehicles | Stakeholder confirmation, September 10, 2026 | Approved |
| Construction vehicles | Stakeholder confirmation, September 10, 2026 | Approved |
| Passenger vehicles | Career qualification language | Recruiting evidence |

**Status:** Approved for fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles.

> Confirmed by stakeholder, September 10, 2026: SB Mobile Installations serves fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles.

Passenger vehicles were not named in the confirmation and stay unverified. Do not widen the published vehicle list beyond fleet, commercial, and construction.

### 12.2 Potential categories requiring verification

- Light-duty fleet vehicles
- Medium-duty trucks
- Heavy-duty trucks
- Vans
- Utility vehicles
- Service vehicles
- Construction equipment
- Trailers
- Off-road equipment
- Municipal vehicles
- Public safety vehicles
- Rental vehicles
- Buses or transit vehicles

Do not publish an unsupported vehicle list merely because a device could technically be installed in that vehicle.

---

## 13. Industries

### 13.1 Supported by existing content

| Industry | Evidence | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial fleets | Fleet vehicle language | Broad recruiting evidence |
| Construction | Construction vehicle language | Recruiting evidence |

### 13.2 Proposed industries

- Transportation and logistics
- Utilities
- Field service
- Telecommunications
- Delivery and distribution
- Government and municipal fleets
- Public safety
- Service and maintenance fleets
- Heavy equipment

**Status:** Proposed.

Each industry requires confirmation of actual experience, desired business development, or operational capability before publication.

---

## 14. Technology and platform experience

The career page asks applicants about experience with the following systems or brands:

- Lytx or DriveCam
- SmartDrive
- Zonar
- LoJack
- Interlock
- PeopleNet
- Trimble
- Omnitracs, formerly Qualcomm
- Samsara
- Geotab
- CalAmp devices
- Verizon Connect
- TPMS equipment
- Windshield-mounted video recorders

### Status

Approved as installation experience. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. See section 9.1 for the confirmation text.

The confirmation establishes that technicians work with these platforms. It establishes nothing about partnership, authorization, or certification, and the usage restrictions below are unchanged by it.

### Usage restrictions

Do not state or imply that SB Mobile is:

- An official partner
- An authorized installer
- A certified installer
- A reseller
- A dealer
- An endorsed provider
- A preferred vendor
- A representative of the platform

Do not use a platform logo until permission and brand guidelines have been confirmed.

### Approved language

Approved framing, stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026:

- “We work with the platforms fleets already run on, including [platforms]”
- “Installation experience with [platform] equipment”
- “Technicians familiar with [platform] hardware”
- “Support for deployments involving [platform] devices”

All four forms describe experience. None asserts a relationship with the platform vendor.

Platform names are approved for visible copy. **Do not use a platform name as a structured-data taxonomy value.** A platform name placed in `serviceType`, `brand`, `provider`, `makesOffer`, or a similar property reads as a formal classification claim and can imply a partnership that is not confirmed.

A platform name may appear inside a structured-data text value that mirrors visible copy, such as an `FAQPage` `acceptedAnswer` whose text must match the rendered answer word for word. The distinction is prose against taxonomy, not presence against absence.

The exact approved wording should be stored in `09-technology-platform-registry.md`.

---

## 15. Technical competencies described in recruiting content

The current career content seeks applicants with experience in:

- Vehicle installation practices
- Electrical systems
- Mechanical work
- Multimeter use
- 12-volt systems
- 24-volt systems
- Electrical connection identification
- Electrical diagnostics
- Troubleshooting failed electrical components
- Completing certain electrical repairs
- Interior panel disassembly
- Exterior panel disassembly
- Dashboard access
- Engine compartment access
- Stereo installation
- GPS and fleet equipment installation

**Status:** Recruiting evidence.

These qualifications describe desired technician experience. They do not prove that every technician holds every competency, that every capability is available in every market, or that SB Mobile provides general automotive electrical repair.

Do not market general automotive repair, stereo installation, panel repair, or broad electrical repair as customer services without confirmation.

---

## 16. Certifications and qualifications

### MECP

The current career page states that MECP is preferred.

**Status:** Existing recruiting preference.

This does not establish that:

- SB Mobile is MECP certified.
- Every technician is MECP certified.
- MECP certification is mandatory.
- The company has an official MECP partnership.

### Other certifications

No other company or technician certifications are currently approved.

### 16.1 Client decision: credentials and proof are not published

**The client has chosen not to publish licenses, certifications, insurance details, reviews, or ratings on the website.**

**Status:** Approved. Client decision, not a pending data gap.

This is a settled decision rather than an unresolved question. Content, design, schema, and conversion work must build around the absence of these elements rather than treating them as forthcoming.

Scope of the decision:

- Licenses and license numbers
- Company and technician certifications, including MECP status
- Insurance carriers, coverage types, and coverage amounts
- Background-screening and drug-screening programs
- Customer reviews, review counts, star ratings, and aggregate rating displays

What this means in practice:

- Do not build page sections, trust bars, badge rows, or components that depend on credentials, insurance, reviews, or ratings.
- Do not emit `AggregateRating`, `Review`, or credential properties in structured data. There is no approved source for them, and a rating property without genuine underlying reviews is a structured-data violation.
- Do not add "pending" or "coming soon" placeholders for these elements.
- Do not treat the absence as a gap to fill during a later content pass.
- Do not imply the credentials exist through indirect phrasing such as "fully vetted", "credentialed technicians", or "covered and protected".

Build credibility instead through the evidence the client does approve: described installation process, documented technical competencies, equipment and vehicle experience, service reach, and clear operational explanation. See sections 15, 17, and 18.

This decision does not relax section 26. The prohibited wording list continues to apply in full, including "Fully insured", "Fully licensed", "Background-checked technicians nationwide", and "MECP-certified technicians nationwide".

Required verification remains open only for internal operational purposes, not for publication:

- Company certifications
- Technician certifications
- Platform certifications
- Safety training
- Electrical qualifications
- Background-check program
- Insurance requirements
- Customer-specific training

---

## 17. Installation process evidence

The career page suggests the following workflow:

1. A project or installation is assigned.
2. The technician receives installation guidelines and approved connection procedures.
3. The technician travels to the customer's location. Shop-location language from an expired job posting was removed on September 10, 2026. See section 5.3.
4. The vehicle is accessed and required panels are disassembled when necessary.
5. The equipment is installed.
6. The technician confirms that installed equipment is functional.
7. The vehicle and work area are kept clean.
8. Required installation data and photographs are submitted.
9. Equipment is tracked and accounted for.
10. The technician maintains communication with scheduling managers.

**Status:** Inferred from recruiting duties.

This workflow is a strong candidate for customer-facing content after the company confirms:

- Actual customer intake process
- Scheduling process
- Site-readiness requirements
- Equipment shipping and custody
- Installation standards
- Quality-control review
- Data submission platform
- Customer acceptance process
- Issue escalation
- Closeout documentation

### 17.1 Confirmed photo documentation

**Every customer is sent installation photo documentation automatically.**

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

> Photo documentation is sent to every customer automatically, without being requested.

Photographs are not only an internal technician submission duty under section 18. They are a delivered customer deliverable, and delivery is unprompted.

Approved for customer-facing copy, including a delivery promise. See section 25 for the approved wording.

This supersedes an earlier confirmation on the same date that read "customers receive or can request installation photo documentation." That wording left automatic delivery unestablished, and the copy written against it described documentation the customer could request. The stakeholder then confirmed the stronger claim directly. **Automatic delivery is the correct claim. On-request is not.** Do not reintroduce conditional or on-request phrasing.

Every other item in the section 17 list stays unconfirmed. Confirming the documentation deliverable does not confirm the intake process, scheduling, equipment custody, installation standards, quality-control review, acceptance, escalation, or closeout.

---

## 18. Quality and customer-service evidence

### Existing statements

The homepage says that SB Mobile strives to provide good customer service and meet customer needs.

The recruiting content expects technicians to:

- Communicate effectively
- Maintain positive customer relations
- Remain in timely contact with scheduling managers
- Keep paperwork organized
- Keep vehicles and workspaces clean
- Confirm equipment functionality
- Submit installation data and photographs
- Account for equipment

### Status

Existing website statement and recruiting evidence, except photograph submission, which was confirmed on September 10, 2026 as a customer-facing deliverable. See section 17.1.

### Unverified quality claims

## 25. Approved factual wording

The following wording closely reflects current website statements and may be used in discovery drafts. Final publication still requires company review.

### Company description

> SB Mobile Installations provides mobile electronic equipment installation services for fleet and construction vehicles.

### GPS service

> SB Mobile Installations provides installation and service for GPS equipment.

### Mobile service

> Mobile technicians travel to customer locations based on project requirements and technician availability.

### Technician experience

> Installation work requires knowledge of vehicle electrical systems, mechanical access, approved connection procedures, equipment testing, and installation documentation.

### Years in business

Client confirmed at 15 years. Approved for use in copy.

> 15 years of mobile installation experience

Acceptable variations include "serving fleets for 15 years" and "15 years of experience installing fleet technology". Use the specific number rather than a vague equivalent. "Decades of experience" remains prohibited under section 26, both because it overstates 15 years and because it is an unsupported superlative.

Do not pair the figure with an unconfirmed founding year, and do not derive a founding date from it.

### Equipment and service scope

Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. Approved for use in copy. See section 9.1.

> SB Mobile Installations installs GPS tracking, ELD, AOBRD, TPMS, and fleet management equipment on fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles.

### Vehicle scope

Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. Approved for use in copy. See section 12.1.

> fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles

Do not extend the list. Passenger vehicles are not confirmed.

### Platform experience

Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. Approved for visible copy. Never as a structured-data taxonomy value. See section 14.

> We work with the platforms fleets already run on, including Samsara, Geotab, Verizon Connect, and others our technicians already know.

### Project capacity range

Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. Approved for use in copy. See section 11.1.

> one vehicle or an entire fleet

Use it to describe project size only. Do not extend it into turnaround time, simultaneous multi-market volume, or a guarantee that a given project will be accepted.

### Photo documentation

Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026. Approved for use in copy. See section 17.1.

> Every installation is photo documented, and you'll receive that documentation automatically.

The confirmation establishes automatic, unprompted delivery to every customer, so a delivery promise is accurate. Do not weaken it into on-request phrasing, and do not extend it into a delivery timeframe, a file format, a delivery channel, or a retention period. None of those was confirmed.

### Service area

Client confirmed nationwide service. Approved for use in copy.

> Nationwide mobile installation service, delivered at the customer's location

### Mobile-only model

Client confirmed. Approved for use in copy.

> Technicians travel to the customer's location. There is no walk-in facility.

### Business hours

Client confirmed at Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Approved for display on contact surfaces once the time zone is confirmed.

### Required caveat

Nationwide service reach is approved. Do not convert it into specific state availability, universal city coverage, immediate or same-day availability, guaranteed technician presence in a named market, or guaranteed national capacity.

Project-size language is part of this caveat. Phrasing such as “one vehicle or an entire fleet” describes capacity, not reach, and the two must never be derived from each other.

**The rule above is unchanged and still governs every unconfirmed capacity claim.** One narrow exception is documented: the project capacity range in section 11.1 was confirmed directly by the stakeholder on September 10, 2026 and is approved on its own evidence. It is not an inference from nationwide reach, and it does not license any further capacity claim. Anything beyond a single vehicle through a full fleet still requires its own confirmation.

---

## 26. Prohibited wording until supported

**"SB Mobile Installations, LLC" in any customer-facing content.** The public name never carries "LLC". This is a hard rule with no approval path, not a claim awaiting support. See section 4.2.

Do not use the following claims without documentation and approval:

- Nation’s leading installer
- Largest installation network
- Number one fleet installer
- Certified nationwide installer
- Authorized installer for a named platform
- Official partner of a named platform
- Available in every city or state
- Same-day nationwide installation
- Guaranteed installation
- Lifetime warranty
- Zero downtime
- Any fleet size, anywhere
- Fully insured
- Fully licensed
- Background-checked technicians nationwide
- MECP-certified technicians nationwide
- Trusted by a named customer
- Thousands or millions of installations
- Decades of experience
- Best-in-class service
- Industry-leading response time
- Complete regulatory compliance

Generic superlatives should also be avoided unless they communicate a specific, supportable customer benefit.

---

## 27. Content rules derived from business truth

All website content must:

- Use the canonical business name and contact information.
- Identify the verification status of new claims during drafting.
- Separate services from technician qualifications.
- Separate platform experience from partnerships.
- Separate service areas from physical locations.
- Separate current capabilities from proposed expansion.
- Separate customer content from recruiting content.
- Avoid invented statistics, customers, results, warranties, and credentials.
- Use precise language about availability and project scope.
- Route unresolved facts back to this document.

| 2026-09-10 | Business hours | Unknown | Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM | Client confirmation | Client | Time zone and holiday exceptions still unconfirmed |
| 2026-09-10 | Service area | Inferred | Nationwide | Client confirmation | Client | Confirms reach, not capacity. Section 26 still applies |
| 2026-09-10 | Operating entity | Existing website statement | SB Mobile Installations, LLC is the sole operating entity | Client confirmation | Client | No Doral Transport LLC relationship exists. Other project documents need follow-up |
| 2026-09-10 | Years in business | Pending verification | 15 years | Client confirmation | Client | Approved for copy. Founding date still unconfirmed |
| 2026-09-10 | Licenses, certifications, insurance, reviews, ratings | Pending verification | Not published, by client decision | Client decision | Client | Build content and schema around their absence. Section 26 unchanged |
| 2026-09-10 | Worker classification | Existing recruiting statement | Independent contractors, not employees | Direct stakeholder confirmation, quoted verbatim in section 7.2 | Stakeholder | Classification only. Contract terms, compensation, schedule, and benefits remain unconfirmed. Supersedes an earlier entry that was reverted because it recorded approval that had not been given |
| 2026-09-10 | Equipment and service scope | Recruiting evidence | GPS tracking, ELD, AOBRD, TPMS, and fleet management equipment, plus dashcam and windshield-mounted video recorder installation | Stakeholder confirmation of a company-authored Glassdoor posting's accuracy to current operations, quoted in section 9.1 | Stakeholder | Supersedes the GPS-only public scope. EOBR devices and generic "mobile electronics" were not named and stay recruiting evidence |
| 2026-09-10 | Vehicle scope | Recruiting evidence | Fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles | Stakeholder confirmation, quoted in section 12.1 | Stakeholder | Passenger vehicles not named, status unchanged |
| 2026-09-10 | Technology and platform experience | Recruiting evidence | Technicians work with the platforms listed in section 14 | Stakeholder confirmation, quoted in section 9.1 | Stakeholder | Experience only. Partnership, authorization, certification, and reseller restrictions in section 14 are unchanged. Approved for visible copy. Never a structured-data taxonomy value |
| 2026-09-10 | Shop locations | Recruiting evidence | No physical office or shop exists | Stakeholder confirmation that the expired Glassdoor "possibility of shop locations" language was outdated and inaccurate | Stakeholder | Retired. Sections 7.1 and 17 corrected. Recorded in section 5.3 so it does not resurface as an unresolved conflict |
| 2026-09-10 | Compensation | Existing recruiting statement | No change | Not asked, not confirmed | Not approved | Explicitly excluded from the scope confirmation above. The $1,600 per week figure from the expired posting must not be treated as current. Section 19 unchanged |
| 2026-09-10 | Project capacity range | Pending verification | Projects from a single vehicle to an entire fleet | Direct stakeholder confirmation, quoted verbatim in section 11.1 | Stakeholder | Capacity range only, and a distinct fact from the nationwide reach in section 8.2. Do not conflate the two or derive either from the other. Simultaneous multi-market volume, turnaround time, and project acceptance remain unconfirmed. The general guardrail in section 25 is unchanged |
| 2026-09-10 | Photo documentation | Pending verification | Customers receive or can request installation photo documentation | Direct stakeholder confirmation | Stakeholder | Superseded the same day by the row below. Recorded so the narrowing is traceable rather than silently overwritten |
| 2026-09-10 | Public company name | Proposed | SB Mobile Installations, with "LLC" never published | Direct stakeholder instruction received outside the build thread and relayed verbatim, quoted in section 4.2 | Stakeholder | Not inferred or proposed by the build. See the provenance note in section 4.2. Hard project-wide rule. Removed from the footer, mobile navigation, privacy policy, terms of use, Open Graph siteName, and the Organization schema name. The registered entity is unchanged and stays internal |
| 2026-09-10 | Brand and action color | Design-system default | Red #B40000 replaces blue #1468FF. Error re-picked to #9D174D. Accent yellow removed | Direct stakeholder confirmation, recorded in sections 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 of `21-design-system.md` | Stakeholder | Source is the brand kit supplied the same day. The error token was changed as a forced consequence: the previous #B42318 sat 3.3 dE2000 from the new brand red. Logo and headline typography remain unresolved |
| 2026-09-10 | Photo documentation | Confirmed as on-request, above | Photo documentation is sent to every customer automatically, without being requested | Direct stakeholder confirmation, quoted verbatim in section 17.1 | Stakeholder | Supersedes the on-request wording. Automatic delivery is the correct claim and a delivery promise is accurate in copy. Delivery timeframe, format, channel, and retention remain unconfirmed. Every other section 17 process item stays unconfirmed |

---

## 31. Current approval summary

At this stage, the project has enough evidence to begin architecture, research, design exploration, and draft content. It does not yet have enough verified business information to publish the complete proposed service, industry, technology, partnership, location, coverage, or trust framework.

### Confirmed as of September 10, 2026

- Canonical telephone number
- No published address, mobile-only operating model
- Business hours, Monday to Friday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM
- Nationwide service reach
- SB Mobile Installations, LLC as the sole operating entity
- 15 years in business
- Worker classification: technicians are independent contractors, not employees
- Client decision not to publish licenses, certifications, insurance, reviews, or ratings
- Equipment and service scope: GPS tracking, ELD, AOBRD, TPMS, and fleet management equipment, plus dashcam and windshield-mounted video recorder installation
- Vehicle scope: fleet, commercial, and construction vehicles
- Technology and platform experience, as experience only, with the section 14 restrictions intact
- No physical office or shop exists; the expired posting's shop-location language is retired
- Project capacity range: a single vehicle through an entire fleet, a fact distinct from nationwide reach
- Photo documentation sent to every customer automatically, without being requested
- Public company name: SB Mobile Installations, with "LLC" never published

### Still required before launch

- Email addresses for every contact pathway
- Which confirmed services carry nationwide reach, and the service registry built from section 9.1
- Customer types and industries
- Founding date, owner, and leadership for entity and About content
- Response expectations, travel terms, turnaround time, and simultaneous multi-market deployment volume, none of which the confirmed capacity range establishes
- The rest of the installation process and quality evidence in section 17, photo documentation excepted
- Compensation, contract terms, schedule, and benefits, which classification alone does not establish
- Time zone and holiday exceptions for published hours

### Resolved: the two homepage About claims

Both claims flagged during the September 10, 2026 content update were raised with the stakeholder and confirmed on the same date. Neither blocks publication.

| Claim | Outcome | Record |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project capacity, “one vehicle or an entire fleet” | Confirmed accurate. Retained in the copy as drafted | Section 11.1 |
| Photo documentation | Confirmed accurate as a customer-facing deliverable, then confirmed again as automatic and unprompted. The copy states a delivery promise | Section 17.1 |

The homepage carries no unverified claim. The remaining launch blockers are the missing `/careers/` and `/services/` routes and the unconfirmed production domain, recorded in `qa/homepage-verification-record.md`.

The immediate priority is a structured business discovery interview covering the items above. Trust and proof content must be planned around the client's decision in section 16.1 rather than waiting on credentials that will not be published.
