## 1. Purpose

This document defines the reusable components and page-template assemblies required to build the SB Mobile Installations website.

It governs:

- component categories and ownership;
- primitive UI components;
- global layout and navigation;
- recruitment components;
- active-job components;
- installer-network components;
- commercial components;
- resource and authority components;
- forms and confirmation states;
- metadata, schema, and analytics helpers;
- responsive and accessibility behavior;
- component states and variants;
- page-template composition;
- testing expectations;
- launch priority; and
- component maintenance.

This is an inventory and behavior specification. Visual tokens, typography, color, spacing, imagery, and detailed styling belong in `21-design-system.md` and `22-image-strategy.md`.

---

## 2. Component Objectives

The component system must:

1. Make recruitment the clearest primary journey.
2. Keep active-job, installer-network, referral, and commercial experiences distinct.
3. Produce crawlable semantic HTML through static rendering.
4. Limit client-side JavaScript to necessary interaction.
5. Support accurate metadata, internal links, and structured data.
6. Make page families consistent without producing thin or near-duplicate pages.
7. Support mobile candidates first, especially job and application flows.
8. Meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA requirements.
9. Preserve truthful business, job, location, and service data.
10. Expose stable analytics hooks without collecting personal information.
11. Remain understandable to future developers and Claude Code.
12. Avoid premature abstraction and unnecessary dependency weight.

---

## 3. Component Principles

### 3.1 Compose from clear layers

Use this component hierarchy:

```text
UI primitive
    -> shared content module
    -> recruitment or commercial domain component
    -> page-family template
    -> App Router route
```

### 3.2 Default to server components

Static and content-focused components should remain server components. Add `"use client"` only to the smallest boundary requiring browser state, events, or APIs.

### 3.3 Reuse structure, not generic copy

Templates may standardize sequence and behavior. Each page must retain unique intent, evidence, content, and conversion logic.

### 3.4 Business data stays outside presentation

Components receive verified typed data. Do not embed phone numbers, addresses, job terms, service areas, or entity claims directly in reusable UI files.

### 3.5 Accessibility is part of the API

Accessible name, keyboard behavior, focus behavior, state announcements, heading level, and error handling must be defined with the component, not added later.

### 3.6 Conversion events reflect real actions

A component may emit a defined interaction event. It must not report a submission or business outcome before the trusted backend confirms it.

### 3.7 Fewer strong variants

Prefer a small explicit variant set over arbitrary style props. Avoid a universal section component that accepts dozens of visual switches.

### 3.8 No hidden publication logic

Components do not decide whether unverified content is safe to publish. Route and data validation control publication and indexation.

---

## 4. Inventory Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Launch required | Needed for the approved launch journey or global site operation |
| Launch conditional | Needed only if the associated verified page or feature launches |
| Phase 2 | Useful after launch when content or inventory justifies it |
| Future | Do not build without a confirmed requirement |
| Utility | Nonvisual or cross-cutting implementation component |

### Build rule

Do not implement every component because it appears in the inventory. Build the smallest set required by approved launch pages, then add components when a page brief or operational need requires them.

## 6. Component Naming Rules

- Use PascalCase for React component names and files.
- Use names that describe purpose, not appearance alone.
- Use domain prefixes when a shared name would be ambiguous.
- Use `Template` only for page-family composition.
- Use `Panel` for a contained decision or action area.
- Use `Card` for a repeatable linked or summarized object.
- Use `List` for collection rendering and empty-state ownership.
- Use `Provider` only for actual context or cross-tree behavior.
- Avoid names such as `Component1`, `ContentBlock2`, `FancyCard`, or `UniversalSection`.

### Examples

| Prefer | Avoid |
|---|---|
| `ActiveJobCard` | `CardVariantThree` |
| `InstallerNetworkPanel` | `BlueCTA` |
| `CommercialContactPanel` | `BottomBox` |
| `JobRequirements` | `IconList` |
| `AnswerBlock` | `TextSection` |

---

## 7. Shared Type Conventions

### Base component props

```ts
type ComponentBaseProps = {
  id?: string;
  className?: string;
};
```

Use `className` only when a component needs deliberate composition flexibility. Do not expose arbitrary visual configuration on every component.

### Link type

```ts
type AppLink = {
  href: string;
  label: string;
  analyticsId?: string;
  external?: boolean;
};
```

### Image type

```ts
type ContentImage = {
  src: string;
  alt: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  priority?: boolean;
  decorative?: boolean;
};
```

### Status rule

Business, job, service, and location records should already be validated before reaching presentational components. Components must not transform an `unknown` or `draft` fact into confident public language.

---

## 8. UI Primitive Inventory

| Component | Status | Purpose | Client component |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `Button` | Launch required | Native form or action button | No by default |
| `LinkButton` | Launch required | Link styled as a clear action | No |
| `Card` | Launch required | Shared structural surface | No |
| `Badge` | Launch required | Short verified category or status | No |
| `Icon` | Launch required | Decorative or labeled icon wrapper | No |
| `Accordion` | Launch required | Accessible disclosure for selected content | Yes |
| `TextInput` | Launch conditional | Accessible text field | Usually no wrapper; form may be client |
| `TextArea` | Launch conditional | Accessible multiline input | Usually no wrapper |
| `Select` | Launch conditional | Native controlled selection | Usually no wrapper |
| `Checkbox` | Launch conditional | Consent or multi-select input | Usually no wrapper |
| `RadioGroup` | Launch conditional | Exclusive controlled options | May be client |
| `Spinner` | Launch conditional | Supplemental pending indicator | No |
| `StatusMessage` | Launch conditional | Success, warning, or error status | No |

### Primitive rule

Prefer native HTML behavior. A styled native control is usually better than a custom recreation.

---

## 9. `Button`

### Purpose

Use for an action occurring on the current interface, such as form submission, step advancement, filtering, or menu activation.

### Required API

```ts
type ButtonProps = React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & {
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "outline" | "quiet" | "danger";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  loading?: boolean;
};
```

### Requirements

- Render a native `<button>`.
- Default `type` must be deliberate; form buttons should state `submit` or `button` explicitly.
- Preserve an accessible name during loading.
- Prevent duplicate submission without trapping recovery.
- Show visible focus.
- Meet target-size and contrast standards.
- Do not use a disabled state as the only explanation for missing information.

### Do not use

For navigation to another URL. Use `LinkButton`.

---

## 10. `LinkButton`

### Purpose

Use for prominent navigation actions such as:

- View Current Openings;
- Apply for This Opening;
- Join the Installer Network; and
- Discuss a Fleet Installation Project.

### Required API

```ts
type LinkButtonProps = {
  href: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "outline" | "quiet";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  external?: boolean;
  analytics?: {
    event: string;
    ctaId: string;
    ctaLocation: string;
  };
};
```

### Requirements

- Render a crawlable link.
- Use meaningful label text.
- Make external behavior clear when it affects the user.
- Do not open a new tab without a specific user benefit.
- Add safe `rel` values for new external tabs.
- Track only approved non-PII parameters.

---

## 11. `Card`

### Purpose

Provide consistent structure for job, role, service, industry, technology, resource, and pathway cards.

### API direction

```ts
type CardProps = {
  as?: "article" | "section" | "div";
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: "default" | "subtle" | "featured";
};
```

### Requirements

- Domain cards define their own content hierarchy.
- Do not make the entire card clickable if it creates nested interactive elements.
- Use one clear link target.
- Equal visual height must not force content truncation that hides requirements.
- Preserve readable focus and hover behavior.
- Cards must stack cleanly on narrow screens.

---

## 12. `Badge`

### Approved uses

- Active opening;
- Closed;
- Travel level when verified;
- Field-based;
- Role category;
- Resource type; and
- verified service or industry category.

### Rules

- Do not use color alone to communicate status.
- Do not show “Urgent,” “Now Hiring,” or scarcity language unless accurate and approved.
- Do not use a badge to imply certification, partnership, or benefit.
- Status text must come from controlled data.

---

## 13. `Accordion`

### Purpose

Use for selected FAQ and secondary-detail groups when collapsing content improves usability.

### Requirements

- Native button controls each panel.
- Use `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` correctly.
- Support keyboard operation.
- Keep headings semantic.
- Content must remain present in server-rendered HTML where feasible.
- Opening a panel must not change the URL unless deep linking is intentionally implemented.
- Motion respects reduced-motion preferences.
- Do not collapse critical job requirements, classification, compensation, travel, or privacy terms simply to make a page appear shorter.

### Analytics

Track only strategically useful FAQ groups. Do not emit an event for every trivial disclosure.

---

## 14. Form Primitive Inventory

| Component | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `FormField` | Label, description, control, required state, and error association |
| `TextInput` | Standard text, email, telephone, or URL input |
| `TextArea` | Controlled free-text input with length guidance |
| `Select` | Native single selection |
| `RadioGroup` | Exclusive options when all choices should remain visible |
| `Checkbox` | Consent or independent selection |
| `FileUploadField` | Approved resume/file selection only |
| `FieldError` | Field-specific error text |
| `FormAlert` | Form-level error, warning, or success status |
| `FormProgress` | Meaningful step status for progressive forms |
| `TurnstileField` | Public widget and state bridge; never server validation |

### Shared requirements

- Persistent visible label.
- Programmatic label association.
- Helpful description before error text.
- Correct autocomplete token where applicable.
- Appropriate input mode.
- No unnecessary input mask.
- Errors connected with `aria-describedby`.

### Default state

When no active jobs exist:

- state that no matching approved opening is currently listed;
- offer the installer network accurately;
- link to installer requirements or role information; and

### Content

- verified service name;
- clear customer-oriented summary;
- approved image or icon;
- relevant equipment or project context;

|---|---|---|
| `ApplicationConfirmation` | Accepted active-job application | “Application received” only after trusted success |
| `NetworkConfirmation` | Accepted future-network registration | “Network registration received,” not application |
| `CommercialConfirmation` | Accepted project inquiry | “Inquiry received,” not quote approved |

- no private record ID exposed;
- realistic next steps;

4. direct answer
5. optional table of contents
6. full structured content
7. key takeaways
8. relevant FAQs
9. related content
10. intent-appropriate CTA
11. Article schema when eligible

### CTA rule

Candidate articles route to careers or relevant openings. Commercial articles route to verified services or project discussion. Do not use a universal CTA.

---

### Safe optional sections

A component may be omitted when its verified data is unavailable, such as:

- compensation panel;
- testimonials;
- case studies;
- partner logos;
- named technology;
- service areas;
- training; or
- statistics.

### Unsafe behavior

Do not:

- fill missing data with generic claims;
- display empty headings;
- generate placeholder cards;
- change a missing active job into an evergreen application;
- create empty location pages;
- render schema fields not shown visibly; or
- hide legally or operationally consequential information simply because the design lacks space.

---

## 80. Variant Governance

### Approved variant categories

- importance: primary, secondary, quiet;
- surface: default, subtle, contrast;
- width: content, wide, full;
- alignment: start, center where appropriate;

- journey: recruitment, network, commercial.

### Rules

- Journey variants may affect visual emphasis but not mix form schemas or analytics.
- Do not accept arbitrary hex colors in component props.
- Do not accept arbitrary heading levels without validating hierarchy.
- Do not add a new variant for one isolated page before considering composition.
- Record new variants in the design system and component tests.

- focus movement when state changes;
- screen-reader state announcement;
- color-independent meaning;
- contrast;
- zoom/reflow behavior;

- color-only status;
- hover-only information;
- focus removal;
- automatic carousel motion without controls;
- inaccessible custom select;
- icon-only button without accessible name;
- skipped heading levels for appearance; and
- form success shown only by color or disappearing form.

---

## 83. Performance Requirements

- Accordion;
- JobFilters when justified;
- ApplicationForm;
- InstallerNetworkForm;

- Lazy-load noncritical third-party widgets.
- Avoid large animation packages.
- Avoid duplicate icon libraries.
- Do not ship all jobs/content as client JSON when static HTML and scoped data suffice.
- Measure bundle impact of every new client dependency.

---

## 84. Search and Crawl Requirements

- Primary content must exist in server-rendered HTML.
- Links must use real anchors.
- Accordion content should remain in HTML.
- Headings must reflect page hierarchy.
- Breadcrumb UI and schema must agree.
- Job cards link to canonical job URLs.

## 86. Component Data Boundaries

### Public data

Safe when verified:

- page IDs;
- content IDs;
- job IDs not linked publicly to a person;
- role and market keys;
- approved public job facts;
- approved business identity;
- public service and resource content;
- CTA identifiers; and
- canonical URLs.

### Private data

Must not enter general components, analytics, URLs, or static output:

- applicant records;
- form answers;
- resumes;
- candidate/contact IDs;
- customer project details;
- ATS/CRM credentials;
- webhook secrets;
- private internal notes; and
- unpublished business records.

Forms may hold user-entered data transiently for submission, but must not pass it to unrelated components or logs.

---

## 87. Error and Empty States

Each collection or interactive component must define:

- loading only when actual async behavior exists;
- empty;
- invalid data;
- unavailable dependency;
- permission or blocked state when applicable;
- successful completion; and
- retry behavior.

### User-facing principles

- Explain what happened.
- State what the user can do.
- Preserve valid input when safe.
- Never expose stack traces or vendor errors.
- Never show success after an unconfirmed request.
- Keep alternative contact information verified.

---

## 88. Loading States

Most page content is static and should not show skeleton loaders.

Use a loading state only for:

- form submission;
- Turnstile initialization;
- an approved external ATS transition;
- client-side filtering on a genuinely large collection; or
- a future dynamic integration.

### Rules

- Preserve control label during loading.
- Announce status.
- Avoid indefinite spinner without explanation.
- Do not block reading content while analytics or a third-party script loads.
- Use progressive enhancement when a dependency is optional.

---

## 89. Component Testing Matrix

| Component class | Unit/component tests | Accessibility tests | Visual tests | End-to-end |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| UI primitives | Yes | Yes | Yes | Selective |
| Navigation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Job cards/list | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Job filters | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Job detail modules | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Forms | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Confirmation states | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Commercial cards | Yes | Yes | Yes | Selective |
| FAQ/accordion | Yes | Yes | Yes | Selective |
| Schema | Yes | Not visual | Not applicable | Output validation |
| Templates | Selective | Yes | Yes | Yes |

---

## 90. Primitive Test Requirements

### Button and link

- correct element;
- accessible name;
- disabled/loading behavior;
- keyboard focus;
- external link safety;
- correct event without duplicate navigation; and
- variant contrast.

### Accordion

- initial state;
- keyboard operation;
- `aria-expanded`;
- panel association;
- multiple/single-open rule;
- reduced motion; and
- content presence in output.

### Form fields

- label association;
- description/error association;
- required state;
- invalid state;
- autocomplete/input mode;
- keyboard and zoom; and
- no analytics leakage.

---

## 91. Recruitment Component Tests

- active job card never accepts closed record;
- closed job hides apply action;
- job details match controlled record;
- role card never implies an opening without one;
- market card does not label a market as office;
- empty jobs state uses network language;
- network panel contains required disclosure;
- application event fires after backend success only;
- application and network confirmations remain distinct;
- sensitive values do not enter event payloads; and
- mobile sticky CTA does not cover controls.

---

## 92. Commercial Component Tests

- commercial CTA remains secondary on mixed-intent pages;
- commercial form uses its own schema and endpoint;
- candidate fields do not appear;
- service/technology card rejects unverified record in published selection;
- partnership labels match controlled relationship type;
- location card uses verified commercial location relationship; and
- commercial confirmation does not promise quote or scheduling.

---

## 93. Story and Preview Fixtures

If a component preview environment is adopted, create synthetic fixtures for:

- shortest and longest approved titles;
- one active job;
- one closed job;
- no active jobs;
- many jobs with filters;
- missing optional job data;
- long market name;
- form validation errors;
- backend failure;
- slow submission;
- network disclosure;
- commercial route; and
- reduced-motion/mobile states.

Do not use real applicant or customer data in fixtures or screenshots.

Storybook or another preview system is not required at launch. Add it only if component count and review workflow justify its bundle, maintenance, and deployment cost.

---

## 94. Component Documentation Standard

Each nontrivial component should document:

- purpose;
- owner/domain;
- server or client boundary;
- props and controlled enums;
- required and optional data;
- states;
- accessibility behavior;
- analytics behavior;
- SEO/schema implications;
- examples or tests;
- prohibited use; and
- launch status.

Simple internal layout components do not need long prose when types and tests make the contract clear.

---

## 95. Dependency Policy

Before adding a component library or package, evaluate:

- actual components needed;
- accessibility quality;
- server/static compatibility;
- client bundle impact;
- styling integration;
- maintenance history;
- licensing;
- dependency tree;
- security posture;
- ability to remove; and
- whether native HTML or a small local component is sufficient.

### Launch recommendation

Use project-owned components and native controls for the initial system. Add a headless UI package only when it materially improves a complex accessible interaction and passes static-export and bundle review.

---

## 96. Avoided Components at Launch

Do not build these without a verified need:

- universal page builder;
- mega menu;
- autoplay hero carousel;
- chat widget;
- site-wide modal lead capture;
- exit-intent popup;
- custom search engine;
- animated statistics counter;
- map with many client-side markers;
- testimonial slider;
- client portal;
- user authentication;
- dynamic personalization;
- complex comparison configurator;
- third-party review carousel; and
- job recommendation algorithm.

These may add distraction, performance cost, privacy risk, or maintenance without improving qualified installer recruitment.

## 102. Open Decisions

1. What approved visual direction will `21-design-system.md` establish?
2. Which launch pages are confirmed?
3. Which active jobs and recruiting markets exist at launch?
4. Will the application be onsite, embedded, or externally hosted?
5. Will installer-network registration launch immediately?
6. Will candidate referrals have a public form?
7. Which commercial pages launch?
8. Which services, industries, technologies, and locations are verified?
9. Which form library, if any, is justified?
10. Which validation library will be used?
11. Will a headless UI package be used for any complex interaction?
12. Is JobFilters justified by the initial opening count?
13. Will a mobile sticky job CTA be used?
14. Will Storybook or another component preview tool be used?
15. Which icon system is approved?
16. What image component strategy will be used for static export?
17. Will Cloudflare Turnstile appear on all public forms?
18. Which testimonials, case studies, logos, or proof are approved?
19. Which analytics/consent provider initializes in `AnalyticsProvider`?
20. Who approves new components and variants?

Unresolved choices must not lead to empty abstractions, fake data, or production placeholders.

---

## 103. Definition of Done

The component inventory is implemented when:

- every approved launch page uses a documented template or deliberate composition;
- global layout and navigation preserve recruitment priority;
- active-job, installer-network, referral, and commercial journeys use distinct components;
- components receive validated typed data rather than hard-coded business facts;
- content components render primary information statically;
- client components are limited to necessary interactions;
- active job and closed job states behave correctly;
- installer-network language never implies an active application;
- forms use separate schemas, endpoints, confirmations, and events;
- submission events require trusted success;
- no PII can enter analytics through component props;
- visible content and JSON-LD share validated sources;
- components meet responsive and WCAG 2.2 AA requirements;
- required component, accessibility, visual, and end-to-end tests pass;
- static export and Cloudflare preview succeed;
- the component system does not require generic filler or duplicate pages;
- design tokens and approved variants are documented in `21-design-system.md`; and
- future inventory items remain unbuilt until a verified requirement exists.

The site architecture defines page families. This document defines their reusable building blocks. The design system will define how those components look and behave visually.

---

## 105. Maintenance Standard

Update this inventory when:

- a page family is added or removed;
- a component is created, renamed, split, merged, or deprecated;
- a form or conversion journey changes;
- job lifecycle states change;
- design variants change;
- analytics events change;
- schema ownership changes;
- a new client-side dependency is added;
- accessibility behavior changes;
- performance findings require a different component boundary;
- a production incident reveals a missing state; or
- repeated one-off implementations reveal a justified reusable pattern.

Remove obsolete inventory items rather than preserving them indefinitely. Record material component-architecture changes in Git and the project decision log.
