## 1. Purpose

This document defines the visual language, interaction rules, content presentation patterns, and implementation constraints for the SB Mobile Installations website.

It works with:

- 20-component-inventory.md for component boundaries;
- 14-conversion-strategy.md for journey and CTA priorities;
- 15-analytics-and-measurement.md for measurable interactions;
- 16-technical-architecture.md for rendering and data boundaries; and
- 23-accessibility-standards.md for detailed accessibility verification.

The system is intentionally practical. It should help candidates decide whether an installer opportunity fits them, help qualified candidates apply, and preserve a credible secondary path for commercial visitors.

---

## 2. Design Outcomes

Every approved page should make these questions easier to answer:

1. What does SB Mobile Installations do?
2. Is this page for an installer candidate, an installer-network contact, or a commercial buyer?
3. What is the next appropriate action?
4. What facts are verified, and what remains subject to review?
5. How can the visitor continue without confusion or unnecessary form friction?

The visual system must support organic search, local discovery, answer engines, and conversion without making pages feel like keyword-targeted templates.

---

## 3. Brand Direction

### 3.1 Personality

The brand should feel:

- capable and technically grounded;
- clear rather than corporate or vague;
- practical and field-aware;
- respectful of candidates' time;
- trustworthy without exaggerated claims; and
- organized enough for commercial buyers to understand the engagement path.

### 3.2 Avoid

- generic “tech company” gradients;
- visual language that suggests a staffing agency unless verified;
- stock imagery of unrelated office teams;
- unsubstantiated “best,” “leading,” or “guaranteed” claims;
- excessive animation, carousels, or pop-ups;
- visually equal treatment of every CTA; and
- designs that hide job status or application requirements.

### 3.3 Audience priority

The homepage and global navigation should give candidates the clearest path to Careers and Current Openings. Commercial pages may use a stronger buyer CTA within their own context, but should not blur buyer and candidate journeys.

---

## 4. Design Tokens

Tokens are the single source for recurring visual decisions. Use CSS variables or Tailwind theme values rather than scattered hex values.

### 4.1 Color tokens

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| color-ink | #111827 | Primary text and headings |
| color-ink-muted | #4B5563 | Supporting text |
| color-surface | #FFFFFF | Cards and primary page surface |
| color-surface-subtle | #F5F7FA | Alternating sections and form backgrounds |
| color-surface-dark | #111827 | Footer and high-contrast panels |
| color-brand | #B40000 | Primary links, buttons, and focus accents |
| color-brand-dark | #8A0000 | Hover and pressed states, and the secondary button label |
| color-brand-soft | #FCEAEA | Tinted panels, selected states, and the closing CTA band |
| color-success | #166534 | Confirmed success state |
| color-warning | #92400E | Caution or incomplete information |
| color-error | #9D174D | Validation and submission errors |
| color-border | #D9E0EA | Borders and dividers |

### Color rules

- Red is the primary action color.
- The error color is a deep rose, deliberately outside the brand's hue. See section 4.1.2.
- Red carries no meaning on its own. An error, a warning, or a success state always pairs color with text, and with an icon or a shape where one is available.

### 4.1.1 Brand color change, blue to red

**Status:** Approved. Stakeholder confirmed September 10, 2026.

Red #B40000 replaces blue #1468FF as the primary brand and action color. The value comes from the brand kit supplied on September 10, 2026, which names it "SB Red" and assigns it to the monogram, emphasis, and calls to action.

Derived values, generated for this change:

| Token | Old | New | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| color-brand | #1468FF | #B40000 | Fills, borders, focus ring |
| color-brand-dark | #0B4DB8 | #8A0000 | Hover and pressed fills, secondary button label |
| color-brand-soft | #E8F0FF | #FCEAEA | Closing CTA band, secondary button hover fill |

Every contrast pairing improved or held. Nothing regressed below its threshold. The two pairings that moved down, the closing CTA heading and body text on the tint, fell by less than 0.2 and stay above 6:1.

The brand kit's black #111111 differs from `color-ink` #111827 by 1.06:1 and 2.1 dE2000. The difference is immaterial and `color-ink` is unchanged.

### 4.1.2 Error color, re-picked

**Status:** Approved. Changed as a direct consequence of the brand change.

The previous error token #B42318 sat **3.3 dE2000** from the new brand red and **1.09:1** in contrast. The two were the same color to the eye. An error message and a primary button would have been indistinguishable by color.

Two strategies were evaluated.

**Separate by lightness, stay in pure red.** Rejected. The darkest usable variants stayed within 8.5 to 14.3 dE2000 of `color-brand-dark`, and `color-brand-dark` is the exact color the secondary button label uses, so error text and button text would still have collided. Below L\* 21 the candidates also began reading as near-black body text.

**Separate by hue, shift to deep rose.** Adopted. **#9D174D** clears every requirement:

| Measure | Value | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dE2000 from color-brand | 22.1 | clearly distinguishable |
| dE2000 from color-brand-dark | 20.3 | clearly distinguishable |
| dE2000 from color-warning | 27.3 | clearly distinguishable |
| Contrast on surface | 7.88:1 | 4.5:1 |
| Contrast on surface-subtle | 7.35:1 | 4.5:1 |
| Contrast on brand-soft | 6.79:1 | 4.5:1 |
| White text on an error fill | 7.88:1 | 4.5:1 |

It stays in the red family, so it still reads as an alarm state, and it is measurably more legible than the token it replaces, which reached only 6.57:1 on surface.

### 4.1.3 Accent yellow removed

`color-accent` #F2EA00 is gone, along with the rule that governed it.

The token was never referenced by any component, page, or stylesheet. The brand kit defines a three-color palette of red, black, and white, and instructs against unauthorized colors. Keeping an unused token that no approved source sanctions invites a future pass to reach for it.

Reintroducing an accent requires stakeholder approval and a contrast check, not a token restore.
- Dark surfaces require tested text contrast and restrained use.
- Error, success, and warning states require text and an accessible status, not color alone.
- Do not use brand colors to imply that an unverified claim is approved.

### 4.2 Typography tokens

Use a highly legible sans-serif family with a system fallback.

**Body face: decided September 10, 2026.** The brand kit asks for Inter, Arial, or Helvetica. The body stack is the system grotesque stack, which already contains Helvetica and Arial:

```
ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, "Segoe UI", Roboto,
"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif
```

No font file is loaded, so the cost against the font budget in section 9 of `24-performance-budget.md` is zero bytes and zero requests. Inter was considered and declined: it satisfies the kit equally but adds a request and a swap on the critical path for no legibility gain over the system faces.

**Headline face: still open.** The kit asks for Anton, Bebas Neue, or Oswald Bold. That decision is deferred to its own performance and licensing review and is not resolved here. Headings currently use the body stack. A display face would be the first web font on the project and must be measured against the LCP target before adoption.

| Token | Suggested size | Line height | Use |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| text-display | 3rem–4.5rem | 1.05 | Homepage and major campaign headline |
| text-h1 | 2.5rem–3.75rem | 1.08 | Page H1 |
| text-h2 | 2rem–2.75rem | 1.12 | Major section heading |
| text-h3 | 1.375rem–1.75rem | 1.2 | Card and subsection heading |
| text-h4 | 1.125rem–1.375rem | 1.25 | Minor heading |
| text-body-lg | 1.125rem | 1.6 | Lead paragraph |
| text-body | 1rem | 1.6 | Default body copy |
| text-small | 0.875rem | 1.5 | Metadata and supporting copy |
| text-label | 0.75rem–0.875rem | 1.3 | Form labels and status labels |

Responsive headings should scale with clamp() but remain readable at narrow widths. Do not use all-caps for long headings.

### 4.3 Favicon and app icons

**Source:** `sb-mobile-installations-monogram-white.png`, composited on a solid `color-brand` tile. The brand kit assigns the monogram to favicon use.

The file named `sb-mobile-installations-favicon-512.png` is **not used and must not be used**. Despite the name it is 512x202, not square, and is one of the lossy exports that carries 176 shades of what is a one-color mark.

**Treatment.** White mark on a red tile, not black on white. The tile is opaque, so the icon holds its shape on light and dark browser chrome alike; a white tile disappears into light chrome. Red and white is also the kit's stated preference for high-contrast applications. At 32px the white-on-red counters survive downsampling marginally better than black-on-white.

**Square crop.** The monogram is 2.54:1 with zero baked-in clear space. The kit sets clear space at the height of the "M" in MOBILE, which measures 158px against the lockup's 1662px width, or 9.5% of the mark's width. That unit is applied horizontally. Vertically, squaring a 2.54:1 mark leaves far more room than the rule requires. Padding is the only faithful option, because cropping or stretching the mark is prohibited.

**Known limitation.** Squaring leaves the glyph at roughly a third of the tile height. It resolves cleanly from 32px up. At 16px the mark renders about 13x5px and is not legible, and no color, crop, or clear-space choice fixes that. A legible 16px icon needs a square-format mark, such as a stacked or single-letter monogram, which does not exist in the current asset set and would require new artwork. Flagged for the stakeholder.

**Generated set.**

| File | Size | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `public/favicon.ico` | 16, 32, 48 | Browser tab |
| `public/icons/apple-touch-icon.png` | 180 | iOS home screen |
| `public/icons/icon-192.png` | 192 | Android and PWA |
| `public/icons/icon-512.png` | 512 | Install and splash |

### 4.4 Spacing tokens

Use a 4px base scale:

4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 120

Recommended defaults:

- card internal padding: 24px;
- mobile section padding: 48px 20px;
- desktop section padding: 80px 24px;
- content column maximum: 720px;
- standard site container maximum: 1200px–1280px;
- card grid gap: 20px–28px; and
- form field gap: 16px.

Use whitespace to separate intent groups. Do not compress headings, descriptions, cards, and forms until they become visually indistinguishable.

### 4.5 Radius, border, and shadow

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| radius-sm | 6px | Inputs and small badges |
| radius-md | 10px | Cards and buttons |
| radius-lg | 16px | Feature panels and media |
| shadow-card | 0 8px 28px rgba(17,24,39,.08) | Elevated cards only |
| shadow-focus | theme-controlled | Keyboard focus treatment |

Use borders before shadows. Avoid making every section look elevated.

---

## 5. Page Canvas and Layout

### 5.1 Global canvas

- Use a light default page background.
- Keep content aligned to a consistent container.
- Allow full-bleed media only when content remains readable and the crop is intentional.
- Keep footer and dark trust panels visually distinct from primary conversion sections.
- Preserve an obvious reading order in the DOM.

### 5.2 Container widths

| Context | Maximum width |
|---|---:|
| Standard page | 1200px–1280px |
| Long-form reading | 720px–780px |
| Job detail content | 900px–1040px |
| Form plus supporting content | 1040px–1160px |
| Full-bleed hero | viewport width with inner container |

### 5.3 Section rhythm

Use a repeatable rhythm:

1. section eyebrow or context label when useful;
2. heading;
3. direct answer or short introduction;
4. primary content module;
5. relevant next step.

Do not force every page into identical section counts. A page earns its length through useful information and evidence.

---

## 6. Navigation and Header

The desktop header includes the logo, primary navigation, and a visibly prioritized Careers or Current Openings link. Commercial navigation may include Services, Industries, Service Areas, Resources, About, and Contact only when those pages are approved.

The mobile menu is a compact client component. It must use a real button, expose expanded state, move focus appropriately, close on Escape, preserve scroll position, place Careers and Current Openings near the top, and remain usable at 200% zoom.

### Header CTA hierarchy

1. Current Openings or Careers when recruitment inventory is active.
2. Join Installer Network when no suitable opening is available.
3. Commercial inquiry on commercial pages.

Never use one generic “Get Started” CTA to route every audience.

---

## 7. Hero System

### 7.1 Shared rules

Every hero has one H1, a short supporting statement, a primary action aligned with page intent, an optional secondary action, a readable image crop or solid surface, and no unsupported proof claim.

Heroes should not contain multiple competing forms. A page can introduce a form immediately below the hero when the journey requires it.

### 7.2 Hero variants

| Variant | Primary use | CTA |
|---|---|---|
| Home hero | Company context and audience routing | Apply as a Mobile Installation Technician |
| Careers hero | Employer and installer opportunity | View Current Openings |
| Job hero | One active or closed opening | Apply for This Opening |
| Role hero | Evergreen role education | Explore Current Openings |
| Commercial hero | Service or buyer context | Discuss a Project |
| Article hero | Answer/resource content | Contextual next step |
| Utility hero | Contact, About, legal | Page-specific action |

The home hero CTA was corrected on September 10, 2026. It previously read "View Current Openings," which conflicted with the approved homepage content. The approved copy is canonical. See `01-business-source-of-truth.md` and the homepage content record.

### 7.3 Hero image placement

- Reserve a calm text area, especially on the left side of image-led layouts.
- If a contact or application panel overlays the right side, keep the far right subdued and uncluttered.
- Use object-position per image rather than accepting an accidental crop.
- Do not place text over high-detail equipment, faces, or critical technical evidence.
- Provide an equivalent solid-background treatment when image contrast cannot pass.

---

## 8. Recruitment Visual Language

Recruitment pages should feel direct and operational. Candidates need practical information more than decorative brand storytelling.

Recommended visual cues include strong status badges for Active, Closed, or Network; compact fact rows for location model, travel, schedule, and classification; checklists for requirements; numbered steps for application and assignment process; prominent but contained Apply actions; and concise FAQ accordions with visible question text.

Do not imply an evergreen role is a current vacancy, hide requirements behind tabs or hover states, use “Join the team” when the page collects network interest, display unverified pay or territory, or make candidates complete a commercial inquiry form.

---

## 9. Job Detail Pattern

The active-job page should present information in this order:

1. job identity and status;
2. location and work model;
3. short fit summary;
4. responsibilities;
5. requirements and preferences;
6. tools, vehicle, travel, or documentation expectations when verified;
7. compensation or classification when approved;
8. application process;
9. application form or approved ATS action;
10. candidate FAQs; and
11. relevant next paths.

The Apply action should remain visible at sensible points without becoming an obstructive sticky element. A closed job removes the active application action and JobPosting schema.

---

## 10. Cards and Grids

### Card anatomy

1. optional image or icon;
2. eyebrow or category;
3. heading;
4. concise summary;
5. optional facts or status;
6. clear link or action.

Card content should be scannable without making every card the same height through artificial filler. Equal-height grids are acceptable only when the layout remains readable and links align predictably.

Card variants include recruitment pathway, active job, installer-network, service, industry or technology, resource, and approved proof cards. Cards must not combine candidate and commercial calls to action in one undifferentiated grid.

---

## 11. Buttons and Links

| Variant | Use |
|---|---|
| Primary | Main page conversion |
| Secondary | Important alternate path |
| Tertiary/link | Supporting navigation |
| Destructive | Only for an actual destructive operation |
| Disabled | Temporary unavailable state, never decoration |

Prefer specific labels such as View Current Openings, Apply for This Opening, Join the Installer Network, Review Installer Requirements, Discuss a Commercial Project, and Contact SB Mobile Installations.

Avoid vague labels such as Learn More, Submit, or Get Started when a specific action can be named.

Buttons and links require a minimum 44px by 44px pointer target, visible hover, focus-visible, active, and disabled states, no color-only state change, native link behavior, and stable analytics IDs.

---

## 12. Forms and Conversion Surfaces

Ask only for information needed for the next business decision. Use separate forms for active applications, installer network interest, commercial inquiries, referrals, and general contact. Put the form purpose and privacy expectation above the first field. Keep labels visible, show errors beside fields and in a summary for longer forms, preserve valid entries after recoverable errors, and never send field values to analytics.

Use a single-column layout by default. A two-column layout is acceptable for short, related fields on wide screens, but must collapse in a logical reading order.

The application form collects only approved candidate information and discloses how it will be reviewed. If an ATS is used, the design makes the handoff explicit and avoids duplicating a second application.

The installer network form uses “Register Interest” or “Join the Installer Network.” Its confirmation never implies that the candidate applied for a specific active opening.

The commercial inquiry form asks for project context, contact details, and routing information. It does not ask candidate-specific questions or promise a quote unless the verified process supports that promise.

Confirmation pages use a distinct visual state, realistic next steps, and noindex behavior. The accepted state appears only after the trusted form or platform response.

---

## 13. Content Presentation

Place a concise answer near the top of informational pages, followed by evidence, detail, examples, and a relevant action. This supports search snippets and human scanning without making copy formulaic.

Use one H1 per page. Headings must reflect content hierarchy, remain meaningful without styling, and never be added only for visual size.

Use real candidate or buyer questions in FAQs. Keep answers visible in HTML even when an accordion is used. FAQ structured data must be generated from the same approved content.

Use semantic tables for relationships such as active opening versus network registration or required versus preferred qualifications. Use definition lists for controlled fact/value pairs.

Bylines, reviewed dates, and update labels appear only when truthful and supported by the content workflow.

---

## 14. Imagery and Media

Use realistic field and equipment imagery that supports the page's actual subject. Prefer natural daylight, credible work environments, and uncluttered compositions.

Image constraints:

- no text overlays, logos, or watermarks in source images;
- no invented branded vehicles or equipment claims;
- no identifiable customer addresses, tenant names, or confidential documents;
- no dramatic damage used merely for attention;
- reserve negative space for copy where required;
- provide descriptive alt text when informative; and
- use empty alt text for decorative imagery.

| Use | Ratio |
|---|---|
| Hero | 16:9 or responsive crop |
| Service or resource card | 16:9 or 7:4 |
| Diagnostic illustration | 4:3 when detail is important |
| Logo or icon | Intrinsic ratio with constrained box |

Use the approved image helper with explicit dimensions, responsive sizes, and modern formats when supported.

---

## 15. Commercial Visual Language

Commercial pages should convey organized project evaluation without overpowering the recruitment-first brand hierarchy.

Use project-fit checklists, process steps, clear service scope, verified industries or technology categories, evidence panels only when sourced, and a direct inquiry panel with expectations.

Do not use the visual language of a large national contractor, certified partner, or equipment manufacturer unless the relationship is verified.

---

## 16. States and Feedback

Every interactive component documents default, hover, focus-visible, pressed, disabled, loading, validation error, server error, empty, success, and closed or unavailable states when applicable.

| Job state | Visual treatment | Allowed action |
|---|---|---|
| Active | Clear Active badge and current facts | Apply |
| Closed | Muted status with explicit closure | Other openings or network |
| No openings | Helpful empty state | Network or requirements |
| Unverified | Internal/build state only | Do not publish |

Do not use loading animation as a substitute for a useful static fallback.

---

## 17. Responsive Rules

Design mobile first. Preserve reading order when columns collapse, stack hero content and forms before text becomes cramped, allow tables to wrap or scroll intentionally with labels intact, keep action buttons full-width where useful, do not rely on hover for meaning, and test narrow widths, tablets, desktop, and 200% zoom.

Mobile priority is page context, primary action, key facts, supporting detail, then secondary navigation.

---

## 18. Accessibility Standard

The target is WCAG 2.2 AA for public pages.

Required behavior includes semantic landmarks, keyboard access, visible focus indicators, sufficient contrast, labels and instructions for controls, error association and recovery, no content dependent on color alone, reduced-motion support, an alt-text strategy, logical focus order, a skip link, an accessible mobile menu, and no keyboard traps.

Detailed test cases belong in 23-accessibility-standards.md and 25-quality-assurance-checklist.md.

---

## 19. Motion and Interaction

Motion should explain change, not decorate the page.

- use short transitions for hover and disclosure state;
- respect the prefers-reduced-motion media preference;
- do not autoplay video or rotate important content;
- do not animate counters that imply unsupported statistics;
- do not delay access to application or inquiry forms; and
- avoid parallax that harms readability or mobile performance.

---

## 20. SEO and Rendering Requirements

Design decisions must preserve server-rendered primary content, crawlable HTML links, stable heading hierarchy, canonical page context, visible breadcrumbs on deep pages, schema matching visible content, accurate active and closed job states, noindex confirmation and utility states, and meaningful page text without JavaScript execution.

Visual components must not hide the answer, requirements, service scope, or location context behind a client-only interaction.

---

## 21. Performance Budget

The initial design supports a fast static site by minimizing client components, avoiding large animation libraries, loading hero media intentionally, using responsive image sources, reserving image dimensions, limiting font families and weights, deferring nonessential media, avoiding unapproved third-party embeds, and testing Core Web Vitals on representative mobile pages.

Specific numeric budgets are governed by 24-performance-budget.md.

---

## 22. Tailwind and Implementation Rules

- Map tokens to Tailwind theme values.
- Prefer component-level variants over long page-specific utility strings.
- Keep content data separate from visual props.
- Use explicit variants such as intent=recruitment or tone=muted only when the contract is stable.
- Do not add arbitrary one-off colors to solve a single page.
- Keep responsive classes grouped by layout purpose.
- Avoid !important except for a documented third-party integration boundary.
- Keep the "use client" directive at the smallest necessary component boundary.

---

## 23. Component Variant Governance

Before adding a variant, answer:

1. Is the content or audience genuinely different?
2. Can a data prop solve the difference without changing layout semantics?
3. Will at least two approved pages use the variant?
4. Does the variant preserve accessibility and analytics behavior?
5. Does it add a documented test fixture?

If not, keep the implementation local or defer it. Do not create a universal component with dozens of boolean props.

---

## 24. Design Review Checklist

- [ ] The page audience and primary action are obvious.
- [ ] Recruitment remains visually prioritized where required.
- [ ] Candidate, network, and commercial paths are not conflated.
- [ ] All controlled facts come from approved data.
- [ ] The heading hierarchy is semantic.
- [ ] Mobile and desktop layouts preserve reading order.
- [ ] Focus, error, loading, empty, and success states exist.
- [ ] Text and controls meet contrast and target-size requirements.
- [ ] Images have correct crop, dimensions, and alt strategy.
- [ ] No unsupported trust, location, compensation, or capability claim was introduced.
- [ ] Primary content is available in static output.
- [ ] Analytics events use approved names and no PII.
- [ ] Schema is generated from the same content source.
- [ ] Build, lint, typecheck, and preview checks pass.

---

## 25. Open Decisions

1. Final font family and licensed weights.
2. Approved logo files and usage clear space.
3. Final photography and illustration set.
4. Whether an application form is onsite, embedded, or ATS-hosted.
5. Whether Turnstile appears on every public form.
6. Confirmed active jobs, recruiting markets, and commercial services.
7. Approved testimonials, customer logos, certifications, and statistics.
8. Final analytics and consent provider.
9. Whether a component preview tool is needed.

Unresolved decisions must not be filled with invented content or placeholder claims in production.

---

## 26. Definition of Done

The design system is ready for implementation when tokens are available to Tailwind and CSS; the component inventory has a documented visual contract; recruitment, network, and commercial variants are distinguishable; typography and spacing are consistent across approved page families; form, job-state, and confirmation states are designed; responsive and accessibility requirements are testable; image rules support static export and performance budgets; design decisions preserve crawlable content and schema alignment; and the system supports new verified pages without generic filler or uncontrolled variants.

## 27a. Approved override, September 18, 2026: palette, typography, and priority

Approved during Sprint 1 planning, recorded here per the plan's documentation-debt requirement, dated 2026-09-18.

**Priority.** Commercial / fleet-manager lead generation is now primary; recruiting is a real, prominent secondary pathway. See `docs/01-business-source-of-truth.md` section 32 for the full record. Every "recruitment CTA is always primary" rule stated earlier in this document (sections 3.2, 3.3, and elsewhere) is superseded: CTA emphasis is now page-context-determined rather than journey-hardcoded, and on commercial pages the commercial CTA is primary.

**Color palette.** The strict red/black/white palette recorded elsewhere in this document (`#B40000`/`#111827`/`#FFFFFF`) is replaced by a navy-and-accent system. `--color-brand`, `--color-brand-dark`, and `--color-brand-soft` are removed. The new tokens:

- `--color-ink`, `--color-ink-muted`, `--color-surface`, `--color-surface-subtle`, `--color-border` are unchanged.
- Dark surfaces: `--color-surface-dark: #0b1220`, `--color-surface-dark-raised: #121b2e`, `--color-border-dark: #1f2a3d`, `--color-text-on-dark: #ffffff`.
- Accents: `--color-accent-blue: #00a8e8`, `--color-accent-blue-strong: #00688a` (finalized, darkened from an initially-proposed `#007ea8` for contrast margin), `--color-accent-amber: #f59e0b`, `--color-accent-green: #22c55e`.
- None of the three bright accents pass WCAG AA as text/icon color on a white surface (2.15-2.70:1 measured); each passes AA against the specific navy `#0b1220` background tested (6.9-8.7:1). That result does not generalize to every navy-family surface or accent combination; each usage is checked against its actual adjacent background. Bright accents are not used as body text, small link text, or standalone icon color on light surfaces.
- `--color-accent-blue-strong: #00688a` with white text is the single verified default-primary-action pair, applied consistently across every primary-action surface (header CTA, mobile sticky CTA, form submit controls, `FinalCta`).
- Focus ring is split by local surface context: `--color-focus-on-light: #0b1220`, `--color-focus-on-dark: #ffffff`, resolved from the nearest `[data-tone]` ancestor rather than a single global rule.
- Radius gains `--radius-xl: 24px`. Shadows gain `--shadow-card-dark`.

**Typography.** The zero-cost system-font decision is replaced. Body copy uses Inter; headings use Rajdhani (condensed, geometric, distinct from body at a glance), both loaded via `next/font/google` in `src/lib/fonts.ts`. Estimated added weight is approximately 55-75KB woff2, recorded against the font budget in `docs/24-performance-budget.md`.

## 27b. Approved refinement, September 18, 2026: SB red identity accent

Restores continuity with the SB logo, whose measured dominant fill is `#B40000` (`logo-red.webp`). Scope is a brand-recognition accent only. Priority, journeys, CTAs, schema, and routes are unchanged.

**Color roles.**

| Role | Token | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary structural color | `--color-surface-dark` and navy family | `#0B1220`, `#121B2E`, `#1F2A3D` |
| Commercial conversion color | `--color-accent-blue-strong` | `#00688A` (white text) |
| Controlled secondary identity accent | `--color-brand-red` | `#B40000` |
| Accessible dark red variant | `--color-brand-red-strong` | `#8F0000` |
| Soft red surface | `--color-brand-red-soft` | `#FDEAEA` |
| Utility/status only | `--color-accent-amber`, `--color-accent-green` | `#F59E0B`, `#22C55E` |

The removed `--color-brand`, `--color-brand-dark`, `--color-brand-soft` names are not reintroduced. Section 4 rows and the "red is the primary action color" statements above remain superseded.

**Approved red uses (use a few, not all).** Thin header top rule; active desktop and mobile navigation underline (light surfaces only, with `aria-current`); footer top rule; opt-in `Card accent="red"` top rule; RecruitingBanner left rail; small decorative graphics; section-label marker.

**Prohibited red uses.** The default commercial CTA or any button fill; large hero backgrounds; body or paragraph text; error messaging (use `--color-error`); repeated card backgrounds; fake urgency or status; focus rings.

**Navy rule.** `#B40000` on `#0B1220` is 2.62:1 and on `#121B2E` is 2.41:1, so both reds fail. On navy-family surfaces red may not be meaningful text, interactive iconography, an active-state or status indicator, a focus ring, or the sole cue for any state. Decorative rules only, where all meaning stays clear without red. `Card accent="red"` is ignored on `tone="dark"`.

**Verified contrast pairs (WCAG 2.x ratio).**

| Pair | Use | Ratio | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `#B40000` on `#FFFFFF` | nav underline, header rail, RecruitingBanner rail | 7.14 | passes AA text and 3:1 non-text |
| `#B40000` on `#F5F7FA` | footer rule | 6.65 | passes |
| `#8F0000` on `#FFFFFF` | dark-on-light variant | 9.69 | passes |
| `#B40000` on `#FDEAEA` | soft surface | 6.17 | passes |
| `#FFFFFF` on `#B40000` | white on red fill | 7.14 | passes (not used for buttons) |
| `#0B1220` on `#B40000` | navy on red fill | 2.62 | fails, do not use |
| `#B40000` on `#0B1220` | red on navy | 2.62 | fails, decorative only |
| `#B40000` on `#121B2E` | red on raised navy | 2.41 | fails, do not use |
| `#FFFFFF` on `#00688A` | primary CTA (unchanged) | 6.27 | passes |
| `#9D174D` on `#FFFFFF` | error token (unchanged) | 7.88 | passes |

**Logo.** Header uses `public/images/brand/logos/sb-mobile-installations-logo-red.svg` (viewBox 1540x779, 14 KB, fill `#B50202`) on the light header row via a plain `img` with intrinsic dimensions, displayed at 120 px (mobile) and 150 px (desktop). `#B50202` on white measures about 7.1:1, in line with `#B40000`. No reverse logo is deployed; the red logo is never placed on navy. The earlier `logo-red.webp` fallback is superseded and no longer referenced. The brand-kit PDF, PNG exports, white reverse, preview renders, and `primary-logo` are not used and stay untracked. The PDF could not be rendered in this environment, so no claim rests on it.
