# SB Mobile Installations Site Architecture

**Document:** `07-site-architecture.md`  
**Project:** SB Mobile Installations Website and Installer Recruitment Project  
**Business:** SB Mobile Installations, LLC  
**Primary website outcome:** Attract and convert qualified installer candidates  
**Secondary website outcome:** Establish commercial credibility and generate qualified customer inquiries  
**Status:** Strategic architecture draft  
**Version:** 0.1  
**Last updated:** September 9, 2026

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the structural organization of the SB Mobile Installations website.

It governs:

- page hierarchy;
- navigation;
- page families;
- candidate and customer journeys;
- launch scope;
- future expansion;
- reusable templates;
- data relationships;
- internal linking;
- breadcrumbs;
- sitemap inclusion;
- publication and indexation states;
- content ownership;
- conversion routing; and
- safeguards against thin, duplicate, expired, or unsupported pages.

Detailed slug, canonical, redirect, and parameter rules belong in `08-url-strategy.md`.

---

## 2. Architecture Principles

### 2.1 Recruitment comes first

Careers must be a top-level navigation destination. Current openings, installer requirements, assignment information, applications, and the installer network must be easy to reach from any page.

### 2.2 Candidate and commercial journeys remain separate

Recruitment and commercial users may share company information, but they must have distinct:

- navigation pathways;
- calls to action;
- forms;
- confirmation pages;
- CRM pipelines;
- follow-up messages;
- analytics events; and
- success definitions.

### 2.3 One intent, one primary page

Each indexable page should own a clear audience need and search intent. Page creation is not justified when an existing page can satisfy the need without becoming confusing or overly broad.

### 2.4 Architecture follows business truth

The site may be designed to support future services, markets, roles, and technologies, but a route must not be publicly represented as current until the underlying facts are verified.

### 2.5 Development, publication, and indexation are separate

A page can be:

- planned but not built;
- built but not public;
- public but not indexed;
- indexed and active;
- paused;
- archived;
- redirected;
- removed; or
- retired.

The project must not assume that a developed route should automatically be published or indexed.

### 2.6 Depth should stay shallow

High-priority pages should generally be reachable within two or three meaningful clicks from the homepage. Deep URL structure is acceptable only when it communicates a real parent-child relationship.

---

## 3. Primary Website Sections

The site will contain six primary systems:

1. **Homepage:** routes candidates and commercial prospects while establishing the company.
2. **Careers:** primary recruitment hub and conversion system.
3. **Services and solutions:** verified commercial capabilities and project needs.
4. **Industries, technologies, and service areas:** conditional expansion based on verified relevance.
5. **Resources and proof:** authority, education, FAQs, and evidence.
6. **Company, contact, and legal:** entity trust, communication, privacy, accessibility, and terms.

---

## 4. High-Level Site Tree

```mermaid

    H["Homepage"] --> C["Careers"]

    C --> J["Current Jobs"]

This tree represents supported architecture, not automatic publication approval for every route.

## 5. Launch Priority Definitions

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Launch | Required for the first complete public release |
| Launch if verified | Required only when the underlying business fact or opportunity is approved |
| Phase 2 | Valuable after launch foundations and operations are stable |
| Conditional | Build or publish only when demand, evidence, and business capability justify it |
| Utility | Supports a workflow but may not be an organic landing page |
| Future | Architecture reservation; not current scope |

- Breadcrumbs reflect actual hierarchy.
- Labels use human-readable names.
- Current page is visible but not linked to itself.
- Breadcrumb structured data must match visible breadcrumbs.

---

## 37. Internal Linking Model

### Recruitment hub-and-spoke model

The careers hub links to role, jobs, requirements, process, FAQs, and network pages. Each supporting page links back to the careers hub and toward the next logical conversion.

### Commercial hub-and-spoke model

Services, industries, technologies, solutions, service areas, resources, and case studies link through verified relationships rather than linking every page to every other page.

### Cross-system links

- Service pages may link to relevant installer opportunities.
- Job pages may link to the verified service category involved.
- About and case studies may support both audiences.
- Commercial and candidate CTAs remain visually distinct.

### Link-quality rules

- Use descriptive anchors.
- Link only when helpful.
- Avoid sitewide exact-match keyword lists.
- Do not link to unpublished or expired pages.
- Check orphan pages automatically.

## 38. Page Family Relationships

| Parent family | Child family | Required relationship |
|---|---|---|
| Careers | Job | Job is active and approved |
| Careers | Role | Role is supported by recruiting strategy |
| Careers | Resource | Resource supports candidate intent |
| Role | Job | Job belongs to role family |
| Job | Market | Location is accurate for the opportunity |
| Job | Technology | Technology is part of approved duties or qualifications |
| Services | Service | Service is verified and marketed |
| Service | Industry | Service is relevant and verified for the industry |

| Solution | Service | Service contributes to the solution |
| Case study | Service | Project used the service |
| Case study | Industry | Project belongs to approved industry context |

## 41. Sitemap Architecture

### XML sitemap inclusion

Include:

- indexable core pages;
- active job pages;
- verified service, solution, industry, technology, and service-area pages;
- indexable resources;
- approved case studies; and
- accurate `lastmod` values.

Exclude:

- confirmation pages;
- private previews;
- drafts;
- internal search and filter URLs;
- duplicate parameter URLs;
- expired or removed jobs;
- noindex utilities; and
- pages blocked from public access.

### HTML sitemap

An HTML sitemap is optional. Create it only if it materially improves discovery for users rather than duplicating primary navigation.

---

## 42. Search and Filter Architecture

### Current openings

Potential filters:

- Role family
- Location or region
- Traveling versus regional
- Engagement type
- Experience level

### Resources

Potential filters:

- Audience
- Topic
- Content type

### Rules

- Do not add filter complexity for a small inventory.
- Use client-side filtering or controlled parameters when appropriate.
- Noindex filter combinations by default.
- Do not allow infinite crawl spaces.
- Maintain accessible controls.
- Preserve useful results without relying on JavaScript alone when server rendering is needed.

---

## 43. Error and Empty-State Architecture

### Required states

- 404 not found
- Closed job
- No current openings
- No matching filtered openings
- Form submission error
- File upload error
- Network interruption
- Expired session when applicable
- Maintenance or temporary unavailability

### Principles

- Explain what happened.
- Preserve user input where practical.
- Offer the correct next step.
- Never imply successful submission when it failed.
- Avoid redirecting every closed job to the homepage.
- Use 404 or 410 when removal is the approved job policy.

---

## 44. Structured Data by Page Family

| Page family | Potential structured data | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Homepage | Organization, WebSite | Verified entity information |
| Careers hub | WebPage, BreadcrumbList | No JobPosting for general careers content |
| Job detail | JobPosting, BreadcrumbList | One real active job; visible content matches |
| Role page | WebPage, BreadcrumbList | No JobPosting unless it is a specific opening |
| Service | Service, BreadcrumbList | Verified service and provider data |
| FAQ | FAQPage when eligible | Visible factual answers and current eligibility |
| Article | Article or BlogPosting, BreadcrumbList | Accurate author, publisher, and dates |
| Service area | Service and appropriate organization references | No false physical location |
| Case study | Article or WebPage | Accurate content and proof |
| About | AboutPage, Organization reference | Verified entity facts |
| Contact | ContactPage, Organization reference | Verified contact data |

Detailed rules belong in `13-schema-markup-plan.md` and `30-job-content-schema-specification.md`.

## 45. Analytics Architecture

### Recruitment events

- Careers hub viewed
- Job index viewed
- Job detail viewed
- Opening filter used
- Requirements viewed
- Assignment process viewed
- Apply clicked
- Application started
- Application field error
- Resume upload completed or failed
- Application submitted

- Commercial phone or email action

### Required dimensions

- Audience journey

CRM outcome data should connect applications to qualification and activation without placing unnecessary sensitive candidate information in analytics.

---

## 46. Performance and Accessibility Architecture

Every page family must support:

- semantic HTML;
- keyboard navigation;
- visible focus states;
- accessible headings;
- descriptive labels;
- useful errors;
- sufficient color contrast;
- responsive layouts;
- reduced-motion preferences;
- optimized images;
- stable layout;
- fast mobile loading; and
- progressive enhancement where appropriate.

The job and application experience receives the highest mobile-performance priority.

---

## 47. Technical Route Model

The planned Next.js App Router structure may follow:

```text
app/
├── page.tsx
├── careers/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── mobile-installers/page.tsx
│   ├── jobs/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── [slug]/page.tsx
│   ├── installer-requirements/page.tsx
│   ├── how-assignments-work/page.tsx
│   ├── apply/page.tsx
│   ├── application-received/page.tsx
│   ├── faqs/page.tsx
│   ├── join-our-installer-network/page.tsx
│   ├── installer-training/page.tsx
│   └── resources/
│       ├── page.tsx
│       └── [slug]/page.tsx
├── services/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [slug]/page.tsx
├── solutions/
├── industries/
├── technology/
├── service-areas/
├── resources/
├── case-studies/
├── faqs/page.tsx
├── about/page.tsx
├── contact/page.tsx
├── request-a-quote/page.tsx
├── thank-you/page.tsx
├── privacy-policy/page.tsx
├── terms/page.tsx
└── accessibility/page.tsx
```

The implementation may use route groups, content collections, or other maintainable patterns as long as public URLs and governance rules remain consistent.

## 48. Reusable Template Inventory

### Recruitment templates

- Careers hub
- Role overview
- Jobs index
- Job detail
- Installer requirements
- Assignment process
- Candidate FAQ
- Installer network
- Recruitment resource
- Application and confirmation

### Commercial templates

- Services hub
- Service detail
- Solutions hub and detail
- Industries hub and detail
- Technology hub and detail
- Service-area hub and detail
- Resource hub and article
- Case-study hub and detail
- Commercial FAQ
- Quote and confirmation

### Shared templates

- Homepage
- About
- Contact
- Legal policy
- Error and empty state

Reusable templates must allow page-specific content and evidence. They should not produce near-duplicate pages.

---

## 49. Launch Scope Recommendation

### Required recruitment pages

- Homepage
- Careers hub
- Mobile installer role
- Current openings index
- At least one verified active job detail when an opening exists
- Installer requirements
- How assignments work
- Application flow
- Application confirmation
- Candidate FAQs
- Installer network

### Required commercial and trust pages

- Services hub
- Verified core service pages
- Commercial FAQs
- About
- Contact
- Request a quote
- Commercial confirmation
- Service areas hub only if meaningful coverage can be verified
- Privacy policy
- Terms
- Accessibility

### Conditional launch content

- Installer training
- Technology pages
- Industry pages
- Solution pages
- Individual service-area pages
- Resources
- Case studies

It is better to launch a smaller accurate architecture than a large unsupported one.

---

## 50. Phase 2 Expansion

After recruiting operations and core pages are stable:

- publish recruitment resources;
- add verified installer stories;
- expand real market-specific job content;
- add training content when approved;
- build verified service clusters;
- publish industry and technology pages with evidence;
- add high-value service areas;
- publish commercial resources;
- develop case studies;
- add advanced job filtering when inventory justifies it; and
- strengthen cross-system internal linking.

## 51. Architecture Risks and Controls

| Risk | Architecture control |
|---|---|
| Recruitment hidden behind commercial navigation | Top-level Careers and Current Openings |
| Candidate and buyer confusion | Distinct journeys, CTAs, forms, and confirmations |
| Fake evergreen jobs | Separate active jobs from installer network |
| Expired jobs remain indexed | Job status, review date, closing workflow, schema removal |
| Thin location pages | Verification and distinct-content prerequisites |
| False office signals | Explicit office, technician base, and service-area distinctions |
| Duplicate intent | Canonical page ownership and cannibalization review |
| Platform-name overreach | Technology approval and relationship status |
| Unmanageable page count | Conditional matrices and phased publication |
| Orphan pages | Parent-child data and automated link checks |
| Sensitive data exposure | Approved form, storage, and access architecture |
| Search crawl waste | Controlled filters, sitemaps, canonicals, and noindex rules |

---

## 55. Maintenance

Review this architecture when:

- a role, service, market, technology, or industry changes;
- the application or CRM system changes;
- navigation changes;
- a new page family is proposed;
- Search Console or Bing data indicates duplication or orphaning;
- job inventory requires new filters;
- legal or privacy requirements change;
- the business model changes; or
- quarterly architecture audits identify stale or unsupported content.

Architecture changes must be reflected in the URL strategy, route registry, sitemap, navigation, internal links, schema, analytics, redirects, content briefs, and QA plan.
