## 1. Document purpose

This document defines the purpose, scope, strategy, operating assumptions, and intended outcomes of the SB Mobile Installations website rebuild. It provides the high-level direction for research, content development, information architecture, design, implementation, deployment, search optimization, and conversion measurement.

This overview is a strategic foundation, not the final authority for every business fact. Verified company information will be maintained in `01-business-source-of-truth.md`. Approved services, industries, audiences, technologies, locations, routes, and page states will be maintained in their respective canonical registries.

When this document conflicts with a verified business fact or a later approved decision, the verified source or approved decision takes precedence.

## 2. Executive summary

SB Mobile Installations, LLC provides mobile electronic equipment installation services for commercial vehicles, fleet vehicles, construction vehicles, and related mobile assets. The existing website presents the company primarily as a provider of GPS equipment installation and service with mobile technicians available throughout the United States.

The available company content also indicates technician experience with electronic logging devices, fleet-management equipment, vehicle camera systems, tire-pressure monitoring equipment, and related 12-volt and 24-volt vehicle electronics. That broader capability is not currently organized or explained effectively for prospective customers.

The new website will reposition SB Mobile Installations as a credible commercial fleet-technology installation and deployment partner. It will explain what the company installs, who it serves, how projects are coordinated, how installation quality is verified, and how prospective customers can request a quote or discuss a deployment.

The website will support national commercial search intent while also creating a controlled framework for verified state, metro, industry, audience, technology, and matrix content. Page creation, production deployment, public availability, and search indexation will remain separate decisions. The project will not automatically publish every possible service, industry, technology, or geographic combination.

The website will be built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Claude will support research and content development. Claude Code and Visual Studio Code will support implementation. GitHub will provide version control, and Cloudflare Pages will provide hosting.

## 3. Business summary

### 3.1 Working business category

SB Mobile Installations operates within the following overlapping business categories:

- Mobile fleet-technology installation
- Commercial vehicle electronics installation
- GPS tracking equipment installation and service
- Electronic logging device installation
- Fleet telematics installation
- Fleet camera and video equipment installation
- Fleet-management hardware installation
- Mobile field-service deployment
- 12-volt and 24-volt vehicle electrical installation

These categories are working classifications. Each service must be verified before it is presented as an approved customer-facing offer.

### 3.2 Working business model

The available content suggests that SB Mobile Installations uses mobile technicians who travel to customer locations, fleet yards, construction sites, or approved shop locations to complete equipment installations.

The company may serve customers directly or may operate as an installation partner for telematics providers, equipment manufacturers, resellers, fleet-management companies, and project coordinators. These potential relationships must be confirmed before final positioning or publication.

### 3.3 Existing stated value

The existing website emphasizes:

- Mobile installation and service of GPS equipment
- Technicians located throughout the United States
- On-site travel to meet customer needs
- Electrical-system knowledge
- Mechanical insight
- Customer service

The existing recruiting content further suggests an operational process involving installation guidelines, approved connection procedures, equipment accountability, functional testing, installation photographs, data submission, communication with scheduling managers, and clean vehicle and workspace standards.

### 3.4 Working market position

The proposed market position is:

> A nationwide mobile installation partner for GPS, ELD, telematics, fleet camera, fleet-management, and connected vehicle equipment.

This position must be refined as services, national coverage, project capacity, customer types, and proof are verified.

---

## 4. Existing website baseline

The existing website is small and contains three primary routes:

| Existing page | Existing route | Primary function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage | `/` | Basic company and GPS installation introduction |
| Contact Us | `/contact-us` | General inquiry form and telephone information |
| Career Opportunities | `/career-opportunities` | Independent mobile technician recruiting |

The current site does not provide dedicated customer-facing pages for individual services, industries, audiences, equipment categories, platforms, service areas, deployment processes, case studies, resources, FAQs, quality standards, or project intake.

Much of the most useful capability information is located on the career page rather than on customer-facing service pages.

### Known data inconsistency

The current contact content displays two telephone numbers:

- 623-338-7352
- 623-388-7352

The correct primary number must be confirmed before the new website, structured data, citations, analytics, directories, or business profiles are configured.

---

## 5. Project problem

The existing website does not fully represent the apparent scope, operational capability, or commercial value of the business.

Primary problems include:

- The service offering is not clearly defined.
- The site does not explain who hires SB Mobile Installations.
- Nationwide capability is stated but not supported with a coverage model or deployment explanation.
- Technical experience is buried in recruiting content.
- Platform experience is not separated from partnership or authorization status.
- There is little visible evidence of project experience, quality control, or completed work.
- The customer inquiry path is generic and does not qualify fleet projects.
- Customer inquiries and technician recruiting are not sufficiently separated.
- There are no service, industry, audience, technology, or verified location content systems.
- The site cannot currently build meaningful topical authority.
- The site does not provide enough structured information for search engines and answer systems.

---

## 10. Proposed website architecture

The website will be organized around distinct customer and search intents.

### 10.1 Core company pages

- Homepage
- About
- How It Works
- Service Areas
- Case Studies
- FAQ
- Request a Quote
- Contact
- Careers
- Legal pages

### 10.2 Service pages

Service pages will explain what equipment or installation work SB Mobile provides.

Preferred pattern:

`/services/[service]/`

### 10.3 Industry pages

Industry pages will explain how installation needs differ by fleet environment and operating model.

Preferred pattern:

`/industries/[industry]/`

---

## 12. SEO, AEO, GEO, and local-search direction

### 12.1 Search engine optimization

Each indexable page will target one clear primary intent and use unique metadata, descriptive headings, original content, semantic HTML, contextual internal links, accessible media, appropriate structured data, and a clear conversion path.

### 12.2 Answer engine optimization

Pages will use direct answers, definitions, numbered processes, requirements lists, comparison tables, checklists, and concise FAQs where they help the customer understand the topic.

### 12.3 Generative engine optimization

The site will improve machine understanding through precise business facts, consistent entity information, clear terminology, first-party evidence, connected topic clusters, crawlable HTML, author and reviewer information where appropriate, and citations to authoritative sources when technical claims require them.

No tactic can guarantee a featured snippet, rich result, knowledge panel, People Also Ask placement, ChatGPT citation, or Perplexity citation.

### 12.4 Local search

Local visibility will be based on real business operations and verified coverage. A technician location is not automatically a company office. State and metro pages must provide accurate and useful coverage information.

Google Business Profile, Bing Places, Apple Business Connect, structured data, directories, and website information must use consistent verified business data.

---

## 13. Conversion strategy

### 13.1 Primary conversion

The primary customer conversion will be:

**Request an Installation Quote**

### 13.2 Secondary conversions

- Discuss a Fleet Deployment
- Check Technician Coverage
- Call SB Mobile Installations
- Submit Project Information
- Apply as a Mobile Technician

### 13.3 Customer intake

The initial form should remain concise while capturing enough information to route and qualify the opportunity.

Potential fields include:

- Contact name
- Company name

- Number of vehicles or assets
- Vehicle types
- Project locations
- Desired timeline
- Project description

Technical qualification can continue through a second-stage form or follow-up workflow.

### 13.4 Lead separation

Customer inquiries, provider partnerships, general inquiries, service requests, and technician applications must use distinct forms, tags, routing, and measurement.

---

## 14. Design direction

The website should feel established, technical, commercial, reliable, and human. It should avoid the appearance of a generic automotive accessory shop or an interchangeable AI-generated service website.

The visual system should emphasize:

- Commercial fleet environments
- Realistic installation equipment
- Vehicle electronics and telematics
- Organized field work
- Technical precision
- Nationwide coordination
- Clear customer outcomes
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Mobile usability
- Accessible color contrast
- Restrained motion

The design system, brand colors, typography, component rules, photography standards, and page references will be defined in `18-design-system.md` and `19-image-media-strategy.md`.

The canonical repository is:

https://github.com/SedrickHarris/sb-mobile-installations-site.git

The repository will contain:

- Source code
- Project documentation
- Canonical registries
- Content templates
- Static media
- Testing and quality checks
- Deployment configuration
- Redirect and route manifests

The branch, commit, pull-request, and production-deployment policies will be documented separately. No workflow should be assumed until it is approved.

Claude Code should preserve unrelated work, use the project documentation as context, report affected files, run required validation, and avoid unrequested deployment or publication actions.

---

## 17. Business-truth governance

Business accuracy takes precedence over content volume, keyword coverage, and marketing language.

The project will not invent or assume:

- Services
- Locations
- Service coverage
- Technician availability
- Certifications
- Partnerships
- Authorized-installer status
- Customer relationships
- Project statistics
- Fleet capacity
- Guarantees
- Warranties
- Pricing
- Regulatory compliance
- Insurance coverage
- Safety credentials
- Platform compatibility

Information should be classified as:

- Verified
- Pending verification
- Proposed
- Inferred
- Prohibited until supported

Platform installation experience must remain distinct from official partnership, authorization, certification, reseller, dealer, or preferred-provider status.

---

## 18. Publication and indexation governance

The project separates:

1. Research
2. Content approval
3. Development
4. Quality assurance
5. Production deployment
6. Public availability
7. Search indexation

A page may be developed and deployed for review without being approved for search indexation.

An indexable page must have:

- Verified business relevance
- A distinct customer intent
- Accurate content
- Sufficient original value
- Appropriate internal links
- A clear conversion path
- Correct canonicalization
- No material conflict with a stronger page
- Approved publication and indexation status

Only approved indexable pages should appear in the XML sitemap.
