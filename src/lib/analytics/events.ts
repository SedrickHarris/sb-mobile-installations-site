/**
 * Event taxonomy, extending the existing `data-event`/`data-journey`
 * attribute pattern already on `CtaButton`.
 *
 * Three journeys, never mixed: `commercial_form_*`, `installer_network_*`,
 * and the job application journey (`active_opening_view`, `cta_apply_click`,
 * and `application_*`). A referral journey has no events yet. See CLAUDE.md
 * section 4 and docs/_claims-inventory.md rows 23 and 51.
 *
 * Application events never carry a name, email, phone, or any answer. They
 * carry only the job slug and counts (see `trackEvent`).
