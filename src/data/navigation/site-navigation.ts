 * destination.
 *

 * routes exist (src/app/industries/, src/app/coverage/). `/case-studies/`
 * and `/resources/` are deliberately still not in this primary nav per the
 * plan; `/case-studies/` is additionally empty (structural only) and must
 * never appear in any navigation while empty. `/resources/` has real,
 * published content but stays a secondary destination, linked from the
 * footer only, to keep the primary nav focused on conversion routes.
