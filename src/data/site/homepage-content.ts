/**
 * Locked homepage copy.
 *
 * Restructured 2026-09-18 for the commercial-first override recorded in
 * 01-business-source-of-truth.md section 32. Every claim here is gated
 * against docs/_claims-inventory.md; nothing marked "needs confirmation"
 * there appears below.
 *
 * Facts used here and their source-of-truth status:
 *   In business since 2011  Approved, section 4 and 25
 *   Nationwide service      Approved, section 8.2
 *   No walk-in facility     Approved, section 5.3. The Waddell corporate office
 *                           (section 33.4) is not an approved homepage surface,
 *                           so the address is not published here.
 *   Mon-Fri 8:00 AM-6:00 PM Approved, section 5.4
 *   Equipment scope         Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 9.1
 *   Vehicle scope           Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 12.1
 *   Platform experience     Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 14
 *   Contractor engagement   Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 7.2
 *   Current installer       Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-19, section 33.1.
 *   openings, candidates    Homepage wording states only that openings exist,
 *   accepted nationwide     for independent contractors, with candidates accepted
 *                           nationwide. No pay figure and no claim that an
 *                           opening is in a named market. The banner's primary
 *                           button is Apply (/careers/apply/), and the
 *                           Installer Network stays a separate secondary link.
 *   Project capacity range  Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 11.1
 *   Photo documentation     Approved by stakeholder 2026-09-10, section 17.1
 *
 * Capacity and reach are separate confirmed facts. "one vehicle or an entire
 * fleet" rests on section 11.1, not on the nationwide reach in section 8.2.
 * Neither may be derived from the other. See the guardrail in section 25.
 *
 * The photo documentation sentence is the approved exact wording: "Every
 * installation is photo documented, and you'll receive that documentation
 * automatically." No timeframe, format, channel, or retention period is
 * added anywhere this sentence appears.
 *
 * Pricing, warranties, guarantees, and response times are omitted entirely
 * per docs/_claims-inventory.md item 21 (unconfirmed across the board).
 *
 * No em dash appears in any string in this file. Section 3.1 of CLAUDE.md is
 * project wide.
