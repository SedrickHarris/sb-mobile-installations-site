 * General operational guidance for fleet managers and technicians planning
 * an installation project - not claims about SB Mobile Installations' own
 * stats, history, or performance beyond what docs/01 already confirms
 * (15 years, photo documentation, nationwide reach, project capacity range).
 * Every article carries `editorialNote`, rendered verbatim near the top of
 * the article body: "This is educational operational guidance, not legal,
 * regulatory, safety, compliance, device-manufacturer, or
 * fleet-management-system advice." ELD-related content specifically avoids
 * any statement that a process guarantees regulatory compliance, and does
 * not characterize SB Mobile Installations as an ELD provider or compliance
 * consultant, consistent with src/data/site/services-content.ts.
