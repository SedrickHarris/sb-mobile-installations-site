/**
 * `/quality-safety/` content.
 *
 * Working brief: the stakeholder-supplied page brief pasted 2026-09-24. No
 * page brief exists in docs/briefs/. Approved by the user that day: the
 * "Quality & Safety" H1 (matches the route and footer label), the replaced
 * meta description, the exact photo-documentation sentence, and the nationwide
 * statement (docs/01 line 1017).
 *
 * SOURCE-OF-TRUTH FLAG: docs/01 section 21 says no company-wide safety
 * program, regulatory compliance statement, insurance coverage, bonding
 * status, or formal installation standard is approved, and section 16.1 is a
 * hard client decision against certifications, licenses, insurance, and
 * placeholders for them. This page is therefore a controlled scope and
 * documentation page. It makes no claim about quality assurance, safety
 * protocols, training, inspection, testing, validation, warranties, or
 * outcomes. The only proof-oriented statement is the approved
 * photo-documentation sentence (docs/01 section 25, claims inventory row 10),
 * used word for word.
 *
 * Service cards and vehicle examples are read from service-pages-content.ts so
 * they cannot drift from the service pages. Q&A answers are user-supplied and
 * kept as written.
