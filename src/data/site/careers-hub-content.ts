 * absent: MECP or other certification as a requirement, days, hours, shifts,
 * weekends, "shop locations", "position", "hiring", platform brand names,
 * trailers, state or city lists, and any promise of contact, review, timing,
 * or assignment. No em dash appears in this file; a spaced hyphen would be
