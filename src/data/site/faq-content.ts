/**
 * `/faq/` commercial information hub content.
 *
 * Working brief: the stakeholder-supplied page brief pasted 2026-09-24. No page
 * brief exists in docs/briefs/. The stakeholder approved on 2026-09-24: the
 * quote-requester audience wording, the dashcam and video recorder wording, the
 * vehicle examples, the ELD physical-installation boundary, and the
 * photo-documentation sentence as the only documentation answer. The hedged
 * photo-documentation answers on other pages (docs/01 section 17.1) are not
 * reused here.
 *
 * The page emits WebPage and BreadcrumbList only. There is no FAQPage, QAPage,
 * or HowTo markup: Google removed FAQ rich results in Search on 2026-05-07 and
 * docs/13 section 35 does not deploy FAQPage.
 *
 * Deliberately absent: pricing, warranties, response times, scheduling, city or
 * state lists, local offices, certification, insurance, platform partnerships,
 * and any statement about how an installation is set up, tested, or verified.
 *
 * The Installer Network is a registration for future opportunities and is not
 * an application. An active opening exists (docs/01 section 33), so no answer
 * says openings do not exist. This page never uses "Apply" and never links to
 * the opening or the application page. Current openings are on /careers/.
