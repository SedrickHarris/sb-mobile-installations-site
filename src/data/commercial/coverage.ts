 * `nationwide` is the only populated key in Sprint 2 - it is the single
 * canonical `/coverage/` page (Tier 0 of the roadmap in the approved plan).
 * `regions`, `states`, and `metros` stay empty objects until Sprint 3+ meets
 * the plan's evidence-gating rubric (existing work/relationships, technician
 * capacity, fleet density, search/lead demand, service relevance, unique
 * proof availability). Route generation reads only populated keys, so these
 * empty objects publish zero routes - see src/app/coverage/ (Sprint 3+ will
 * add src/app/coverage/[state]/ etc. reading from `states`).
 *
 * Every claim below is gated against docs/_claims-inventory.md and
 * docs/01-business-source-of-truth.md section 25 (approved factual wording).
 * No `Service.areaServed` state enumeration is derived from this data in
 * Sprint 2 - see src/lib/schema/webpage.ts, used (not servicePageSchema) for
 * `/coverage/`.
 *
 * Service names, descriptions, and routes are read from the approved service
 * cards (service-pages-content.ts), never retyped here, so they cannot drift
 * from the service pages. The vehicle examples and their clarification come
 * from the same shared source.
